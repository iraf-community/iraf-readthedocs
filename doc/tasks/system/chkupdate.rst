  This task was designed to compare the currently installed IRAF version
  with what is available from the NOAO servers. Since NOAO is
  transitioning IRAF to an end-of-support state, and has taken NOAOâ€™s
  IRAF distribution offline, this tool is not useful anymore. For the
  Community version of IRAF, please check the web site
  https://iraf-community.github.io for new versions. IRAF packages in
  Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu are automatically kept
  up-to-date.
