IRAF 2.18 Release Notes
=======================

:Authors: IRAF Community, NOIRLab
:Date: April 05, 2024

The current IRAF version 2.18 is available from Github at

https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/releases/tag/v2.18

Changes to the version 2.17.1 include:

- **Integration of NOIRLab changes**

  NOIRLab recently published their own 2.18 version with the scope
  limited to the support of the Gemini data reduction pipeline. All
  NOIRLab changes are bugfixes, based on NOAO version 2.16.1. They
  were reviewed and (if useful) integrated into the IRAF baseline.
  This merge also triggers the update of the major version number to
  be in sync with the NOIRlab version.

- **VOTable support removed**

  This is a consequence of merging the changes from NOIRlab, resulting
  in a significant simplification of the code. If this creates
  significant problems to the users, we will re-add VOTable support,
  however.
  
- **Command Language start script renamed to irafcl**

  As already done since years in several Linux distributions, the
  **cl** and **ecl** scripts are renamed to **irafcl**. **cl** and
  **ecl** often conflict with the Common Lisp executable names and
  require third special effort by third parties to circumvent
  problems. For compatibility, **cl** and **ecl** are still provided
  as links, but their use is deprecated. Please use **irafcl**
  instead. A man page is provided.

- **Support for the LoongArch architecture**

  Support for using IRAF on the Chinese LoongArch LA64 architecture
  was added. Binaries will be provided as part of the Debian loong64
  port.

- **Bug fixes and code cleanup**

  As before, a number of bugs was fixed in this release. Cleaning up
  the code and modernization of the code structure continued. This is
  in large parts a benefit of integrating the NOIRLab changes.
