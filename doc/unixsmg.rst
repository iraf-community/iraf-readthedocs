:abstract:

   An IRAF *site manager* is anyone who is responsible for installing
   and maintaining IRAF at a site.  This document describes a variety
   of site management activities, including configuring the device and
   environment tables to provide reasonable defaults for the local
   site, adding interfaces for new devices, configuring and using IRAF
   networking, the installation and maintenance of layered software
   products (external packages), and configuring a custom site LOCAL
   package so that local software may be added to the system.
   Background information on multiple architecture support, shared
   library support, and the software management tools provided with
   the system is presented.  The procedures for rebooting IRAF and
   performing a sysgen are described.  The host system resources
   required to run IRAF are discussed.


Introduction
============

The IRAF system should be runnable as soon as it is installed, but there
remain various things one might want to do to tailor the system to the local
site.  Examples of the kinds of customizations one might want to make are the
following.

* Edit the default IRAF environment definitions to provide reasonable
  defaults for your site.
  
* Make entries in the device descriptor tables for the devices in use
  at your site.

* Code and install new device interfaces.

* Enable and configure IRAF networking, e.g., to permit remote image
  display, tape drive, or file access.
  
* Perform various optimizations, e.g., stripping the system to reduce disk
  usage.
  
* Extend the system by installing layered software products.

* Configure a custom LOCAL package so that locally developed software
  may be installed in the system.
  
Beginning with IRAF V2.12 the new install procedures may handle some of this
post-install configuration automatically, however the site manager is
responsible for performing these duties once the system is installed on
the system.
This document provides sufficient background information and instructions to
guide the IRAF site manager in performing such customizations.  Additional
help is available via the `adass.iraf` newsgroups on USENET, by sending
mail to `iraf@noao.edu`, or via the IRAF HOTLINE (520/318-8160).
Contributions of interfaces developed for new devices, or any other software
of general interest, are always welcomed.

The IRAF software is organized in a way which attempts to isolate, so far as
possible, the files or directories which must be modified to tailor the
system for the local site.  Most or all changes should affect only files in
the local, dev, and hlib (unix/hlib) directories.  Layered software
products, including locally added software, reside outside of the IRAF core
system directory tree and are maintained independently of the core system.

A summary of all modifications made to the IRAF system for a given IRAF
release is given in the *Revisions Summary* distributed with the
system.  Additional information will be found in the system notes files
(notes.v211, notes.v212, etc.) in the iraf/local and iraf/doc directories.
This is the primary source of technical documentation for each release and
should be consulted if questions arise regarding any of the system level
features added in a new release of the core system.

System Setup
============

Installing the System
---------------------

The procedure for installing or updating a UNIX/IRAF system is documented in
the *IRAF Installation Guide* distributed with each system.  A custom
installation guide is provided for each platform on which IRAF is supported.
In short, an IRAF CDROM or network distribution is obtained and installed
according to the instructions.  The result is a full IRAF system, including
both sources and executable binaries for the architectures to be supported.
The system will have been modified to reflect the new IRAF root directory
and should run, but will otherwise be a generic IRAF distribution.  To get
the most out of an IRAF installation it will be necessary to perform some of
the additional steps outlined in the remainder of this document.

Configuring the Device and Environment Tables
---------------------------------------------

Teaching IRAF about the devices, network nodes, external programs, and other
special resources available at a site is largely a matter of editing a
standard set of device descriptor and environment setup files, all of which
are simple text files.  The versions of these files provided with the
distribution are simply those in use on the NOAO system from which the 
distribution files were made, at the time the distributions were generated.
Hence while these files
may be useful as examples of properly configured descriptor files, the
defaults, and many specific device entries, will in many cases be
meaningless for a different site.  This is harmless but it may be confusing
to the user if, for example, the default printer doesn't exist at your
site.  Where possible default values are set to be meaningful for sites
outside of NOAO, e.g. the default printer is 'lp' which is simply the 
default printer for the system rather than some NOAO-specific device.

The device and environment files also contain much material which any site
will need, so care must be taken when editing the files.  Important changes
may be made to the global portions of these files as part of any IRAF
release.  To facilitate future updates, it is wise where possible to isolate
any local changes or additions so that they may simply be extracted and
copied into the new (distributed) version of the file in a future update.

Environment definitions
.......................

Since IRAF is a machine and operating system independent, distributed system
it has its own environment facility apart from that of the host system.
Host system environment variables may be accessed as if they are part of the
IRAF environment (which is sometimes useful but which can also be
dangerous), but if the same variable is defined in the IRAF environment it
is the IRAF variable which will be used.  The IRAF environment definitions,
as defined at CL startup time, are defined in a number of files in the
`iraf$unix/hlib` directory.  Chief among these is the `zzsetenv.def` file
which defines the default hardcopy devices, image frame buffer, buffer
sizes, etc. Additional user modifiable definitions may be given in the
template `login.cl` file (see \(sc2.2.2).

The zzsetenv.def file contains a number of environment definitions.
Many of these define IRAF logical directories and should be left alone.
Only those definitions in the header area of the file should need to be
edited to customize the file for a site.  It is the default editor,
default device, etc. definitions in this file which are most likely to
require modification for a site.

If the name of a default device is modified, the named device must also have
an entry in the `termcap` file (terminals and printers used for text
hardcopy) or the `graphcap` file (graphics terminals and image displays
and graphics hardcopy printers) in `iraf/dev`.
There must also be an `editor.ed` file in `dev` for the
default editor; *edt*, *emacs*, and *vi* are examples of
currently supported editors.

Sample values of those variables most likely to require modification for
a site are shown below.

.. code::

        set editor      = "vi"
	set printer     = "lp"
	set stdplot     = "lp"
	set stdimage    = "imt512"

For example, you may wish to change the default editor to "emacs", the
default printer to "lw5", or the default image display to "imt1024".  Note
that the values of terminal and stdgraph, which also appear in the
`zzsetenv.def` file, have little meaning except for debugging processes run
standalone, as the values of the environment variables are reset
automatically by *stty* at login time.  The issues of interfacing new
graphics and image display devices are discussed further in \(sc5.

The template LOGIN.CL
.....................

The template `login.cl` file `hlib$login.cl`, is the file used by *mkiraf*
to produce the user `login.cl` file.  The user `login.cl` file, after having
possibly been edited by the user, is read by the CL every time a new CL is
started, with the CL processing all environment and task definitions,
package loads, etc., in the login file.  Hence this file plays an important
role in establishing the IRAF environment seen by the user.

Examples of things one might want to change in the template `login.cl`
are the commented out environment definitions, the commented out CL
parameter assignments, the foreign task definitions making up the default
`user` package, and the list of packages to be loaded at startup
time.  For example, if there are host tasks or local packages which
should be part of the default IRAF operating environment at your site,
the template `login.cl` is the place to make the necessary changes.

The TAPECAP file
................

Since V2.10 IRAF magtape devices are described by the "tapecap" file,
*dev$tapecap*. This replaces the *devices* file used in earlier versions
of IRAF.  The tapecap file describes each local magtape device and controls all
i/o to the device, as well as device allocation.

In V2.10 IRAF there was one tapecap file per IRAF installation and all client
nodes sharing the same central version installation required device entries
in the global tapecap file.  Since V2.11 this scheme was generalized to
allow each host to have its own private tapecap file, with a fallback to
the generic tapecap file if no host-specific file is found. 
The system will look first for a configuration file called
*tapecap.<node>* where *<node>* is the hostname of the server
the tapecap file describes, if that is not found the default tapecap
file will be used.  
In this way a separate tapecap file can be created for
each node allowing a name such as `mta` to always refer to the first tape
on that machine regardless of whether it varies in type from node to node.
On the other hand, sites may wish to maintain only a single tapecap file
with generic names describing each of the different types of tapes available
in the local network.  In this case it is wise to also configure the
*devices.hlp* file described in the next section to document the names
of the devices to be used to avoid any confusion.

The tapecap files included in the distributed system include some generic
device entries such as `mtxb1` (Exabyte unit 1, Sun ST driver), `mthp2`
(HP7880 9 track drive, unit 2), and so on which you may be able to use as-is
to access your local magtape devices.   The exact list of available device
types depend on the platform in question.  Most likely you will want to add
some device aliases, and you may need to prepare custom device entries for
local devices.  There must be an entry in the tapecap file for a magtape
device in order to be able to access the device from within IRAF.  All magtape
device names *must* being with the two-letter prefix `mt`.

Configuring new TAPECAP entries
...............................

The "tapecap" file is text data base file (similar to the
"termcap" and "graphcap" files) describing the capabilities and 
device names associated with a particular tape device on the system.  For
information on the format of the file see the termcap(5) man page. A listing
of all recognized fields is given in the program comments for the tape
driver in *iraf$unix/os/zfiomt.c* (more on this later).  In general, creating
a new tapecap entry for a device is a matter of finding a similar entry in
the distributed file, and either using that directly if the device names are
correct, or simply modifying it slightly to change device names so it will
be appropriate for a drive on a different SCSI unit or using a different host
driver.  On occasion, other tapecap parameters will need to be added to
correct for specific behavior that affects appending new data and tape
positioning.

A tapecap entry for a device is usually divided into three different sections:
a high-level entry giving the name of the drive as known to IRAF, a mid-level
section defining the host device names associated with the drive, and
a low-level
generic section describing capabilities associated with all instances of a
particular type of drive (DAT, Exabyte, 9-track, etc.).  The starting point 
for the tapecap entry is whatever iraf name was used to access the drive.
This is usually something like `mta`, `mtb`, etc but can be any valid name
beginning with an `mt` prefix and which defines all the needed parameters.
When searching for a particular tapecap parameter the *first* occurrence
of that parameter in the entry is used by the system, and a complete tapecap 
description is composed of all the entries which are linked by the `:tc`
continuation fields.

As an example consider a typical entry for a DAT drive on unit 0 known to
a Solaris/IRAF system as 'mta', the high-level entry would look like: 

.. code::

   mta|Generic DAT entry, unit 0|         :tc=mtst0.solaris.dat:

Here we define the iraf name (which must begin with an `mt` prefix)
along with any aliases delimited by the `|`.  The `:tc` field
continues the tapecap at the next entry named `mtst0.solaris.dat`:

.. code::

   mtsd0|mtst0.solaris.dat|DAT drive on Solaris:\
          :al=0 0bn 0cb 0cn 0hb 0hn 0lb 0ln 0mb 0mn 0u 0ubn \
          0b 0c 0cbn 0h 0hbn 0l 0lbn 0m 0mbn 0n 0ub 0un:\
          :dv=0bn:lk=0:tc=solaris-dat:

This entry is primarily used to specify the host device names associated with
the drive.  The `:al` (aliases) field is a list of *all* device
aliases in the UNIX */dev* or */dev/rmt* directories associated with this device.
This is needed so the tape allocation task can properly change the permissions
and ownership on *each* device name which accesses that tape drive. The
`:dv` (device) field is the *no-rewind* device name and is the
device file actually opened for tape I/O;  this must be a no-rewind device
since IRAF will maintain the tape position automatically, the actual value
typically depends on the
density of the tape, whether compression is used etc.  The `:lk` is used
to build the name of a "lok file" that is created in the */tmp* directory of the
machine hosting the drive that will be used to maintain the tape status and
position information, this value should be unique for each drive on the
machine to avoid conflicts.  When configuring a new tapecap entry, all one
usually needs change is the iraf device name in the first section and the
host device names in the `:dv`, `:al` and `:lk` fields of this entry.  Finally this
section continues the entry with a `:tc` field saying to branch to the
`solaris-dat` generic entry:

.. code::
   
   solaris-dat|sdat-60m|Sun/Solaris DAT drive:\
          :dt=Archive Python 4mm Helical Scan tape drive:tt=DG-60M:\
          :ts#1274378:bs#0:mr#0:or#65536:fb#10:fs#127000:mf:fe#2000:

The low-level entry here is where parameters relating to all drives of a
particular type using a particular host tape driver are maintained, e.g.
the record sized used for tape I/O, positioning capabilities, filemark sizes,
etc.  These will rarely need to be changed from the distributed entries unless
you are using a new tape driver or a different model tape drive, or a
type of tape cartridge with a capacity different than that given (`tz`).
See the section below for a full list of the tapecap parameters and their
meanings.

For a more complicated example let's consider how to add an entry for an
Exabyte 8505 drive given an existing entry for an Exabyte 8200 device.  We
can ignore for now the low-level entry found in the distributed tapecap and
concentrate on what fields actually need changing in this case.  We begin
with the high-level entry defining the iraf names, we will need one name for
the drive in each of three modes (8200 mode, 8500 mode, and 8500 mode w/
compression):

.. code::

   mta|Exabyte 8200, Unit 0|            :tc=mtst0.solaris.exb8200:
   mtb|mtblo|Exabyte 8505, Unit 0|      :tc=mtst0.exb8505-lo:
   mtbhi|Exabyte 8505, Unit 0|          :tc=mtst0.exb8505-hi:
   mtbc|Exabyte 8505, Unit 0|           :tc=mtst0.exb8505-c:

The new iraf names are therefore *mtb* (8200 mode), *mtbhi* (8500
mode), and *mtbc* (8500 + compression).  These all link to the second
level entry where we make use of the existing EXB8200 entry:

.. code::

   mtsee0|mtst0.solaris.exb8200|Exabyte 8200 drive on Solaris:\
            :al=0 0bn 0cb 0cn 0hb 0hn 0lb 0ln 0mb 0mn 0u 0ubn \
            0b 0c 0cbn 0h 0hbn 0l 0lbn 0m 0mbn 0n 0ub 0un:\
            :dv=0bn:lk=0:tc=solaris-exb8200:
   mtsee0lo|mtst0.exb8505-lo|:dv=0lbn:tc=mtsee0:
   mtsee0hi|mtst0.exb8505-hi|:dv=0mbn:fs#48000:ts#5000000:tc=mtsee0:
   mtsee0hic|mtst0.exb8505-c|:dv=0cbn:fs#48000:ts#5000000:tc=mtsee0:

Note that the names we just created link to the one-line entries below the
standard EXB 8200 entry `mtst0.solaris.exb8200` (the `mtb` entry could
just as legally have linked to this entry right away). Since all we need to
change is the `:dv` field (because we're opening the same drive, but by
using a different name the host system accesses it in the appropriate mode)
we can simply make a new entry point, change the `:dv` field and then link to
the existing entry where all the rest of the parameters will be the same.
In this case we've also reset the `:fs` and `:ts` fields to override
the values in the low-level Exabyte description since these have also changed
for the new model drive.  If we wished to modify this entry for a drive on 
e.g. unit 2 all we would need to do is modify the various `:dv`, `:al`, and `:lk`
fields so the device names are correct, and change the name of the tapecap
entry points so we avoid any confusion later on.

When configuring a new tapecap and encounter problems it is useful to turn on
status output so you get a better idea of where the tape is positioned and
what's going on, to do this use the `:so` field as follows:

.. code::
   
   cl> set tapecap = ":so=/dev/tty"

Alternatively, the `:so` can be specified on the command line, e.g.

.. code::

   cl> rewind "mta[:so=/dev/tty]"

Any other tapecap parameters can be specified in the same way.  The
quotes around the tape name are required if any special characters such as
`=` are included in the device name string.  Status output like
this can also be directed to an *Xtapemon* server running either locally
or remotely, see the xtapemon man page for details.  Help with configuring
new tapecap entries is available from IRAF site support.

More on TAPECAP parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As we see from the previous section, in most cases the only tapecap parameters
that need to be changed are `:dv`, `:al`, and maybe `:lk`.  There
are however a number of other tapecap parameters that sometimes must be 
modified to describe how the tape device operates or to optimize I/O to
the device.  A full listing of the available tapecap parameters can be found
in the program comments for the iraf tape driver *iraf$unix/os/zfiomt.c*; we
will only briefly discuss a few here.  Any changes you make with the
parameters mentioned here can usually go in the low-level tapecap entry so
they will "fix" all drives of the same type, however you may also wish to
modify just the high-level entry to change only one drive.  For example:

.. code::
   
   mta|Generic DAT entry, unit 0|      :se:ow:tc=mtst0.solaris.dat:

would add the `:se:ow` fields (discussed below) to only the `mta` device.

Boolean tapecap parameters may be negated if you are linking to an existing
entry which already defines a particular field.  For example, in

.. code::
   
   mta|Generic DAT entry, unit 0|      :se@:tc=mtst0.solaris.dat:

the `@` character would negate the `:se` field regardless of whether it
is defined elsewhere in the entry.

One of the most common problems encountered is that only odd-numbered images
on a tape are readable by the drive.  The solution to this is usually to add
a `se` to the tapecap to tell the driver that the tape will position
past the EOT in a read.  Another common problem is with appending
new data to an existing tape, this sometimes requires the addition of a
`ow` field to tell the driver to backspace and overwrite the EOT
when appending.  A `re` is sometimes needed if there is a problem
sensing the EOT when reading all images from a tape, this tell the
driver that a read at EOT returns an ERR.

The parameter `fb` may be specified for a device to define the "optimum"
FITS blocking factor for the device.  Unless the user explicitly specifies the
blocking factor, this is the value that the V2.11 *wfits* task will use
when writing FITS files to a tape.  Note that for cartridge devices a FITS
blocking factor of 22 is used for some devices; at first this may seem
non-standard FITS, but it is perfectly legal, since for a fixed block size
device the FITS blocking factor serves only to determine how the program
buffers the data (for a fixed block device you get exactly the same tape
regardless of the logical blocking factor).  For non-FITS device access the
magtape system defines an optimum record size which is used to do things
like buffer data for cartridge tape devices to allow streaming.

Some devices, e.g. most Exabyte drives, are slow to switch between
read and skip mode, and for files smaller than a certain size, when skipping
forward to the next file, it will be faster to read the remainder of the
file than to close the file and do a file skip forward.  The `fe` parameter
is provided for such devices, to define the "file equivalent" in kilobytes
of file data, which can be read in the time that it takes to complete a
short file positioning operation and resume reading.  Use of this device
parameter in a tape scanning application such as *rfits* can make a
factor of 5-10 difference in the time required to execute a tape scan of
a tape containing many small files.

On a device such as most cartridge tape devices where backspacing is
not permitted or does not work reliably it may be necessary to set the
`nf` parameter to tell the driver to rewind and space forward when
backspacing to a file.

Lastly, when configuring a new low-level generic entry for the device it is
sometimes necessary to change the various size parameters for the drive.
These include:

======== ==============================================
`bs`     device block size (0 if variable)
`fb`     default FITS blocking factor (recsize=fb*2880)
`fe`     time to FSF equivalent in file Kb
`mr`     maximum record size
`or`     optimum record size
`fs`     approximate filemark size (bytes)
`ts`     tape capacity (Mb)
`dn`     density
======== ==============================================

All but the last three fields are used either by the driver or a task when
reading or writing a tape, the `:fs`, `ts` and `:dn` fields are
used by tape monitoring tasks such as *xtapemon* to compute the approximate 
amount of tape used and do not affect tape operation.  For devices which are
capable of variable block size I/O (i.e. almost anything but a cartridge
tape) it is best to leave the `bs` field at zero.  The maximum and
optimum record sizes, the `mr` and `or` fields, are usually
determined by the host tape driver used.  Values for these can either be
found in the host driver man page or it's system include file.

The DEVICES.HLP file
....................

All physical devices that the user might need to access by name should be
documented in the file *dev$devices.hlp*.  Typing

.. code::
   
   cl> help devices

or just

.. code::
   
   cl> devices

in the CL will format and output the contents of this file.  It is the IRAF
name of the device, as given in files such as termcap, graphcap, and
tapecap, which should appear in this help file followed by a brief
description of the device, see the distributed file as an example.  Starting
with V2.10 this file in no longer used to configure tape devices, it is
informational only.  While not required for an operational runtime system,
it is recommended that site managers document devices in this file for 
their users as well as for their own use when later updating the system.

The TERMCAP file
................

There must be entries in this file for all local terminal and printer
devices you wish to access from IRAF (there is currently no "printcap" file
in IRAF).  The entry for a printer contains one special device-specific
entry, called `DD`.  This consists of three fields: the device name,
e.g. `node!device`, the template for the temporary spoolfile, and the UNIX
command to be used to dispose of the file to the printer.  On most UNIX
systems it is not necessary to make use of the node name and IRAF networking
to access a remote device since UNIX *lpr* already provides this
capability, however it might still be useful if the desired device does not
have a local *lpr* entry for some reason.  Printer devices named in this
file may be used for text hardcopy output such as you get from the LPRINT
task, graphics hardcopy devices are configured by editing the
*graphcap* file discussed in the next section.

As an example, assume we have a printer known to the sun as `lw5`, the
termcap entry would look something like:

.. code::
   
   lw5|lp5|                                :tc=sapple5:
   
   sapple5|sapple|Apple laser writer NT on Orion:\
        :co#80:li#66:os:pt:ta^I:\
        :DD=lpnode!apple,/tmp/asfXXXXXX,!{ lpr -Plw5 $F; rm $F; }:

To then create an entry for a new device named `lw16` simply copy this
entry and change the `5` to `16` in the device and termcap entry 
names, and especially in the *lpr* command of the `DD` string.  
The `$F` denotes the name
of the file to be printed, specifically the temp file created so it should
be removed to avoid filling up the disk.  Note that the `DD` string
can contain any valid unix command to print a file to a specific device, we
use various local print commands, Enscript, etc.

If you have a local terminal which has no entry in the IRAF termcap file,
you probably already have an entry in the UNIX termcap file.  Simply copy it
into the IRAF file; both systems use the same termcap database format and
terminal device capabilities.  However, if the terminal in question is a
graphics terminal with a device entry in the graphcap file, you should
add a `:gd` capability to the termcap entry.  If the graphcap entry
has a different name from the termcap entry, make it `:gd=<gname>`.

The GRAPHCAP file
.................

There must be an entry in the graphcap file for all graphics terminals, batch
plotters, and image displays accessed by IRAF programs.  We will discuss
each briefly since the setup is slightly different in each case.  Help
preparing new graphcap device entries is available from iraf site support
if needed, but with the exception of new graphics terminals creating an entry
for a new device is usually just a matter of editing an existing entry.  We
ask that new graphcap entries be sent back to us so that we may include
them in the master graphcap file for all to benefit.

Graphics hardcopy devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Graphics hardcopy devices nowadays are typically Postscript printers, but
support is included in the system for various pen and raster plotters, and 
non-PostScript printers such as HP LaserJet, Imagen, QMS, etc.  We will 
concentrate here on PostScript devices since they are the most common.  The
typical graphcap entry will look something like

.. code::
   
   lp5|lw5|                :tc=uapl5:
   
   uapl5|UNIX generic interface to 300dpi printer on Orion:\
        :xs#0.269:ys#0.210:ar#0.781:\
        :DD=apl,tmp$sgk,!{ sgidispatch sgi2uapl $F -l$(XO) -w$(XW) \
        -b$(YO) -h$(YW) -p$(PW) | lpr -Plw5; rm $F; }&:tc=sgi_apl:

where the device is known to the system as *lw5* or *lp5*.  The
entry is very similar in form to the `termcap` entry discussed above,
and changing it for a new device is primarily a matter of changing the 
device names.  The exception however is in the `DD` string: here instead
of a simple print command we invoke an SGI translator via the 
*sgidispatch* command (in this case the *sgi2uapl* translator) which
is used to the convert the graphics kernel metacode to PostScript for the 
final printing.  The arguments to the *sgi2uapl* translator are the
device resolution and offset parameters obtained from the *sgi_apl*
entry linked by the `:tc` field at the end of the graphcap entry.  The output
from the translator is piped to a printer and the temp file is removed.

If we wish to convert this entry for a different type of printer, aside from
the changing the name in the graphcap entries and the print command,
the DD string may have to be changed to call a new SGI translator
with the appropriate arguments, and the final `:tc` field would have to link
to a new entry appropriate for that device.  In V2.12 the following SGI
translators are available: 

============ ================================================
sgi2gif      GIF image converter
sgi2uapl.c   PostScript for LaserWriters and PS plotters
sgi2ueps.c   Encapsulated PostScript, PS-Adobe-3.0, EPSF-3.0
sgi2uhpgl.c  HP Graphics Language for HP 7550A and others
sgi2uhplj.c  HP Printer Command Language (LaserJet Series)
sgi2uimp.c   Impress language for Imagen printers
sgi2uptx.c   Printronix plotter
sgi2uqms.c   QMS Vector Graphics (Talaris Lasergrafix)
sgi2xbm      B-bitmap image converter
============ ================================================

In addition, Versatec plotters are supported (no SGI translator needed).

Image display frame buffers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Graphcap entries are required to configure the available `stdimage`
devices for the system.  These are basically just frame buffer configurations
describing the size of the image display being used (whether it's an actual
frame buffer such as an IIS mode 70 or a display server such as XImtool or
SAOimage).  A typical entry for a 512x512 frame buffer looks like:

.. code::
   
   imt1|imt512|imtool|Imtool display server:\
       :cn#1:LC:BS@:z0#1:zr#200:DD=node!imtool,,512,512:tc=iism70:

Here the `:cn` field is the configuration number and the frame buffer
size is given in the `DD` field.  For display servers such as XImtool
the configuration number is passed to the server which then uses that as an
index to the *imtoolrc* file (normally installed by the system as a link
to `dev$imtoolrc`) it uses to determine the frame buffer size to be used.
When adding a new frame buffer you need to be sure the :cn field is unique
and the size in the graphcap file agrees with the size in the imtoolrc file
for that config, *both* files must be edited for the new size to be 
recognized correctly.  Note that SAOimage has a limit of 64 possible frame
buffers that will be recognized, XImtool, DS9 and SAOtng recognize up to 128 
possible configurations.

Graphics Terminals
++++++++++++++++++

New graphics terminals will need a new entry in the graphcap file if one
does not already exist.  The IRAF file gio$doc/gio.hlp
contains documentation describing how to prepare graphcap device entries.  A
printed copy of this document is available from the iraf/docs directory in
the IRAF network archive.  However, once IRAF is up you may find it easier
to generate your own copy using *help*, as follows:

.. code::
   
   cl> help gio$doc/gio.hlp fi+ | lprint

This will print the document on the default IRAF printer device which will
be the default printer for your machine or the one named by your UNIX
`PRINTER` environment variable (use the "device=" hidden parameter to
specify a different device).  Alternatively, to view the file on the
terminal,

.. code::
   
   cl> phelp gio$doc/gio.hlp fi+

The help pages for the IRAF tasks *showcap* and *stty* should also
be reviewed as these utilities are useful for generating new graphcap
entries.  The i/o logging feature of *stty* is useful for determining
exactly what characters your graphcap device entry is generating.  The
*gdevices* task is useful for printing summary information about the
available graphics devices.

Configuring IRAF networking
...........................

The dev directory contains the files (`hosts` and
`irafhosts` that areused by the IRAF network interface.
IRAF networking is used to access remote image displays, printers, magtape
devices, files, images, etc. via the network.  Nodes do not necessarily have
to have the same architecture, or even run the same operating system, so
long as they can run IRAF.

To enable IRAF networking for a UNIX/IRAF system, all that is necessary is to
edit the "hosts" file.  Beginning with V2.12 a post-install configuration
option allows the appropriate entry for the machine to be automatically
entered in the hosts file, and it is recomended that all machines which run
IRAF have the install script run on the machine to ensure proper operation.
In cases where it's necessary to manually create a new node entry, the
site manager can make an entry for each logical node, in the format

.. code::
   
   nodename [ aliases ] ":" irafks.e-pathname

following the examples given in the hosts file supplied with the
distribution (which is the NOAO/Tucson hosts file).  Note that there may be
multiple logical entries for a single physical node, however duplicate
'nodename' entries should be avoided.

The "irafhosts" file is the template file used to create user .irafhosts
files.  It does not have to be modified, although you can do so if you wish
to change the default parameter values given in the file.

To enable IRAF networking on a particular IRAF host, the host OS
*hostname* (i.e. the output of the unix *hostname* command) must
appear as a primary name or alias somewhere in the IRAF hosts table.  
On systems where this is the fully qualified host name (FQHN) the node
name may exceed a limit 16-character limit on a node name so at least
one alias should include a truncated version of the FQHN, the entire FQHN
should appear on the right side of the ':' in the irafks.e pathname.
During process startup, the IRAF VOS looks for the system name
for the current host and automatically disables networking if this name is
not found.  Hence IRAF networking is automatically disabled when the
distributed system is first installed - unless you are unlucky enough to
have installed the system on a host with the same name as one of the nodes
in the NOAO host table.  Note that it may be best to simply delete the
NOAO host table entries since any duplicate with a local host entry will
will cause the IRAF "cd" command to fail and may have other consequences.

Once IRAF networking is configured, the following command may be typed in
the CL to verify that all is well:

.. code::
   
   cl> netstatus

This will print the host table and state the name of the local host.
Read the output carefully to see if any problems are reported.

Alternatively, users can set up a private hosts table by copying the system
version and making any additions.  To then make use of this define a
CL environment variable *irafhnt* which is the path to the private hosts
file.  For example,

.. code::
   
   cl> copy dev$hosts home$myhosts      # make private copy
   cl> edit home$myhosts                # edit any changes
   cl> reset irafhnt = home$myhosts     # reset hosts table to be used
   cl> flpr 0                           # reinitialize system to use it

You can also define a UNIX *irafhnt* variable in the same way prior to
logging into the CL to accomplish the same thing.

For IRAF networking to be of any use, it is necessary that IRAF be installed
on at least two systems.  In that case either system can serve as the server
for an IRAF client (IRAF program) running on the other node.  It is not
necessary to have a separate copy of IRAF on each node, i.e., a single copy
of IRAF may be NFS mounted on all nodes (you will need to run the IRAF
*install* script on each client node).  If it is not possible to install
IRAF on a node for some reason (either directly or using NFS) it is possible
to manage by installing only enough of IRAF to run the IRAF kernel server.
Contact IRAF site support if you need to configure things in this manner.

UNIX IRAF systems currently support only TCP/IP based networking.
Networking between any heterogeneous collection of systems is possible
provided they support TCP/IP based networking (virtually all UNIX-based
systems do).  The situation with networking between UNIX and VMS systems is
more complex.

Once IRAF networking is enabled, objects resident on the server node may be
accessed from within IRAF merely by specifying the node name in the object
name, with a "*node!*" prefix.  For example, if *foo* is a network
node,

.. code::
   
   cl> page foo!hlib$motd
   cl> allocate foo!mta
   cl> devstatus foo!mta

In a network of "trusted hosts" the network connection will be made
automatically, without a password prompt using the *rsh* protocol.
A password prompt will be generated if the user does not have permission to
access the remote node with UNIX commands such as *rsh* since the system
will fall back to an 'rexec' protocol.  The environment variable `KSRSH`
may be defined to use an alternate connection protocol, e.g. *ssh* or
*remsh*.  It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss the
configuration of *ssh* for local networks, for now we will assume that
*rsh* is a supported networking protocol.  Hosts are made
"trusted" in a network by listing them in the system `/etc/hosts.equiv`
file, most often when rsh fails it's because this file hasn't been configured
(usually for security reasons).  User's can configure a `.rhosts` file in
their UNIX login directories (see the rhosts(5) man page) to make the hosts
trusted for their account and bypass the passwd prompt.  Each user also has
a .irafhosts file in their UNIX login directory which can be used to exercise
more control over how the system connect to remote hosts.  See the discussion
of IRAF networking in the *IRAF Version 2.10 Revisions Summary* (in
iraf$doc/v210revs.ms), or in the V2.10 system notes file, for a more in-depth
discussion of how IRAF networking works.

To keep track of where files are in a distributed file system, IRAF uses
*network pathnames*.  A network pathname is a name such as
"foo!/tmp3/images/m51.pix", i.e., a host or IRAF filename with the node name
prepended.  The network pathname allows an IRAF process running on any node
to access an object regardless of where it is located on the network.

Inefficiencies can result when image pixel files are stored on disks which
are cross-mounted using NFS.  The typical problem arises when imdir (the
pixel file storage directory) is set to a path such as "/data/iraf/user/",
where /data is a NFS mounted directory.  Since NFS is transparent to
applications like IRAF, IRAF thinks that /data is a local disk and the
network pathname for a pixel file will be something like "foo!/data/iraf"
where "foo" is the hostname of the machine on which the file is written.  If
the image is then accessed from a different network node the image data will
be accessed via an IRAF networking connection to node "foo", followed by an
NFS connection to the node on which the disk is physically mounted, causing
the data to traverse the network twice, slowing access and unnecessarily
loading the network.

A simple way to avoid this sort of problem is to include the server name
in the imdir, e.g.,

.. code::
   
   cl> set imdir = "server!/data/iraf/user/"

This also has the advantage of avoiding NFS for pixel file access - NFS is
fine for small files but can load the server excessively when used to access
bulk image data.

Alternatively, one can set imdir to a value such as "HDR$pixels/", or
disable IRAF networking for disk file access.  In both cases NFS will be
used for image file access.

Configuring the IRAF account
............................

The IRAF account, i.e., what one gets when one logs into UNIX as "iraf",
is the account used by the IRAF site manager to work on the IRAF system.
Anyone who uses this account is in effect a site manager, since they have
permission to modify, delete, or rebuild any part of IRAF.  For these and
other reasons (e.g., concurrency problems) it is recommended that all routine
use of IRAF be performed from other accounts (user accounts).

If the system has been installed according to the instructions given in the
installation guide the login directory for the IRAF account will be
iraf/local.  This directory contains both a `.login` file
defining the environment for the IRAF account, and a number of other "dot"
files used to setup the IRAF system manager's working environment.

Most site managers will probably want to customize these files according to
their personal preferences.  In doing this please use caution to avoid losing
environment definitions, etc., which are essential to the correct operation
of IRAF, including IRAF software development and maintainence.

The default login.cl file supplied in the IRAF login directory uses machine
independent pathnames and should work as-is (no need to do a *mkiraf* -
in fact *mkiraf* has safeguards against inadvertent use within the IRAF
directories and may not work in iraf/local).  It may be necessary to edit
the .login file to modify the way the environment variable `IRAFARCH`
is defined.  This variable, required for software development but optional
for merely using IRAF, must be set to the name of the desired machine
architecture, e.g., sparc, vax, rs6000, ddec, etc.  If it is set to the name
of an architecture for which there are no binaries, e.g., generic, the CL
may not run, so be careful.  The alias *setarch*, defined in the iraf
account .login, is convenient for setting the desired architecture for IRAF
execution and software development.

Configuring user accounts for IRAF
..................................

User accounts should be loosely modeled after the IRAF account.  All that is
required for a user to run IRAF is that they run *mkiraf* in their
desired IRAF login directory before starting up the CL.  Defining
`iraf` or
`IRAFARCH` in the user environment is not required unless the user
will be doing any IRAF based software development (including IMFORT).
Programmers doing IRAF software development may wish to source
hlib$irafuser.csh in their .login file as well.

Tuning Considerations
---------------------

Stripping the system to reduce disk usage
.........................................

If the system is to be installed on multiple CPUs, or if a production
version is to be installed on a workstation, it may be necessary or
desirable to strip the system of all non-runtime files to save disk space.
This equates to deleting all the sources and all the reference manuals and
other documentation, excluding the online manual pages.  A special utility
called *rmfiles* (in the SOFTOOLS package) is provided for this
purpose.  It is not necessary to run *rmfiles* directly to strip the
system.  The preferred technique is to use "mkpkg strip" as in the following
example (this may be executed from either the host system or from within
IRAF).

.. code::
   
   % cd $iraf
   % mkpkg strip

This will preserve all runtime files, permitting use of the standard system
as well as user software development.  Note that only the IRAF core system
is stripped, i.e., if you want to strip any external layered software
products, such as the NOAO package, a *mkpkg strip* must be executed
separately for each - *cd* to the root directory of the external package
first and be sure to include the "-p *pkg*" switch to mkpkg so the proper
environment is loaded. For example, to strip the NOAO package:

.. code::
   
   % cd $iraf/noao
   % mkpkg -p noao strip

A tape backup of a system should always be made before the system is
stripped; keep the backup indefinitely as it may be necessary to restore the
sources in order to, e.g., install a bug fix or add-on software product.

Software Management
===================

Multiple architecture support
-----------------------------

Often the computing facilities at a site consist of a heterogeneous network
of workstations and servers.  These machines will often have quite different
architectures or operating systems.
Since IRAF is a large system it is undesirable to have to maintain a separate
copy of IRAF for each machine architecture on a network.  For this reason
IRAF provides support for multiple architectures within a single copy of IRAF.
To be accessible by multiple network clients, this central IRAF system will
typically be NFS mounted on each client.  It should be noted however that
it is not always possible to use the multiple architecture support within
the core system itself to maintain a single IRAF source tree for the entire
heterogeneous network.  The Host System Interface (HSI) for IRAF ports is
different for platforms as diverse as Sun and Linux so there should be a
separate installation for each system to minimize difficulties (the update
schedules usually differ as well so maintaining the same version is also
more difficult).  Almost any combination of architectures may be supported
by a single copy of an external package.

Multiple architecture support is implemented by separating the IRAF sources
and binaries into different directory trees.  The sources are architecture
independent and hence sharable by machines of any architecture.  All of the
architecture dependence is concentrated into the binaries, which are collected
together into the so-called BIN directories, one for each architecture.
The BIN directory contains all the object files, object libraries, executables,
and shared library images for an architecture, supporting both IRAF execution
and software development for that architecture.  A given system can support
any number of BIN directories, and therefore any number of architectures.

In IRAF terminology, when we refer to an "architecture" what we really
mean is a type of BIN.  The correspondence between BINs and hardware
architectures is not necessarily one-to-one, i.e., multiple BINs can exist
for a single compiler architecture by compiling the system with different
compilation flags, as different versions of the software, and so on.  Examples
of some currently supported IRAF V2.12 software architectures are shown below.

============ ========= ===============================================
Architecture	System	Description
============ ========= ===============================================
generic	     any	no binaries
alpha	     Dec Alpha	DEC Alpha running Digital Unix
freebsd	     PC	        PC platforms running FreeBSD
hp700	     HP	        HP 700 series running HPUX 10
irix	     SGI	SGI IRIX, MIPS cpu
linux	     PC	        PC platforms running Linux (Slackware, Debian, etc)
linuxppc     PC	        PowerPC platforms running Linux
sparc	     Sun-4	Sun SPARC (RISC) architecture, integral fpu
sunos	     PC	        PC platforms running Solaris x86
suse	     PC	        PC platforms running SuSE Linux
ssun	     Sun-4	Sun SPARC under Solaris (RISC) architecture, integral fpu
redhat	     PC	        PC platforms running RedHat (or Mandrake) Linux
macosx	     PC	        Macintosh OS X systems
============ ========= ===============================================

Most of these correspond to hardware architectures or operating system
distribution options.  The exceptions is the generic architecture, which is
what the distributed system is configured to by default (to avoid having any
architecture dependent binary files mingled with the sources).

When running IRAF on a system configured for multiple architectures,
selection of the BIN (architecture) to be used is controlled by the UNIX
environment variable `IRAFARCH`, e.g.,

.. code::
   
   % setenv IRAFARCH alpha

would cause IRAF to run using the alpha architecture, corresponding to the
BIN directory bin.alpha.  Once inside the CL one can check the current
architecture by entering one of the following commands (the output in each
case is shown as well).

.. code::
   
   cl> show IRAFARCH
   alpha

or

.. code::
   
   cl> show arch
   .alpha

If IRAFARCH is undefined at CL startup time a default architecture will be
selected based on the current machine architecture, the available floating
point hardware, and the available BINs.  The IRAFARCH variable controls not
only the architecture of the executables used to run IRAF, but the libraries
used to link IRAF programs, when doing software development from within the
IRAF or host environment.

Shared libraries
----------------

Among the UNIX based versions of IRAF, currently only Sun/IRAF (for SunOS
and Solaris) and OSF1/IRAF for the DEC Alpha supports
shared libraries, although we are looking into adding shared library support
to the other, mostly SysV based versions of IRAF.  SunOS has an unusually
powerful virtual file system architecture, and several years ago was one of
the few UNIX systems supporting shared, mapped access to files.  This is no
longer the case however, and nowadays most versions of UNIX provide some
sort of shared library facility.  Shared libraries result in a considerable
savings in disk space, so eventually we will probably implement the facility
for additional platforms.  In the meanwhile, if you are running IRAF on a
system other than a Sun or DEC Alpha this section can be skipped.

Sun/IRAF provides a shared library facility for SunOS 4.1 and Solaris 2.5.1
and later operating system versions.  of SunOS.  All architectures are
supported.  So long as everything is working properly, the existence and use
of the shared library should be transparent to the user and to the site
manager.  This section gives an overview of the shared library facility to
point the reader in the right direction in case questions should arise.

What the shared library facility does is take most of the IRAF system
software (currently the contents of the `ex`, `sys`,
`vops`, and `os` libraries) and link it together into a special
sharable image, the file `S<n>.e` in each core system BIN
directory (`<n>` is the shared image version number, e.g. "S8.e").  This
file is mapped into the virtual memory of each IRAF process at process
startup time.  Since the shared image is shared by all IRAF processes, each
process uses less physical memory, and the process pagein time is reduced,
speeding process execution.  Likewise, since the subroutines forming the
shared image are no longer linked into each individual process executable,
substantial disk space is saved for the BIN directories.  Link time is
correspondingly reduced, speeding software development.

The shared library facility consists of the *shared image* itself,
which is an actual executable image (though not runnable on all systems),
and the *shared library*, contained in the library lib$libshare.a,
which defines each VOS symbol (subroutine), and which is what is linked
into each IRAF program.  The shared library object module does not consume
any space in the applications program, rather it consists entirely of symbols
pointing to *transfer vector* slots in the header area of the shared
image.  The transfer vector slots point to the actual subroutines.

When an IRAF program is linked with *xc*, one has the option of linking
with either the shared library or the individual system libraries.  Linking
with the shared library is the default; the `-z` flag disables linking
with the shared library.  In the final stages of linking *xc* runs the
HSI utility *edsym* to edit the symbol table of the output executable,
modifying the shared library (VOS) symbols to point directly into the shared
image (to facilitate symbolic debugging), optionally deleting all shared
library symbols, or performing some other operation upon the shared library
symbols, depending upon the *xc* link flags given.

At process startup time, upon entry to the process main (a C main for
Sun/IRAF) the shared image will not yet have been mapped into the address
space of the process, hence any attempted references to VOS symbols would
result in a segmentation violation.  The *zzstrt* procedure, called by
the process main during process startup, opens the shared image file and
maps it into the virtual space of the IRAF program.  Once the IRAF main
prompt appears (when running an IRAF process standalone), all initialization
will have completed.

Each BIN, if linked with the shared library, will have its own shared image
file `S<n>.e`.  If the shared image is relinked this file will be
moved to `S<n>.e.1` and the new shared image will take its place;
any old shared image files should eventually be deleted to save disk space,
once any IRAF processes using them have terminated.   Normally when the
shared image is rebuilt it is not necessary to relink applications programs,
since the transfer vector causes the linked application to be unaffected
by relocation of the shared image functions.

If the shared image is rebuilt and its version number (the `<n>` in
`S<n>.e`) is incremented, the transfer vector is rebuilt the new
shared image cannot be used with previously linked applications.  These
old applications will still continue to run, however, so long as the older
shared image is still available.  It is common practice to have at least
two shared image versions installed in a BIN directory.

Further information on the Sun/IRAF shared library facility in given in the
IRAF V2.8 system notes file.  In particular, anyone doing extensive IRAF
based software development should review this material, e.g., to learn how
to debug processes that are linked with the shared image.

Layered software support
------------------------

An IRAF installation consists of the core IRAF system and any number of
external packages, or "layered software products".  As the name suggests,
layered software products are layered upon the core IRAF system.  Layered
software requires the facilities of the core system to run, and is portable
to any computer which already runs IRAF.  Any number of layered products can
be installed in IRAF to produce the IRAF system seen by the user at a
given site.

The support provided by IRAF for layered software is essentially the same as
that provided for maintaining the core IRAF system itself (the core system
is a special case of a layered package).  Each layered package (usually this
refers to a suite of subpackages) is a system in itself, similar in
structure to the core IRAF system.  Hence, there is a LIB, one or more BINs,
a help database, and all the sources and runtime files.  A good example of
an external package is the NOAO package.  Except for the fact that NOAO is
rooted in the IRAF directories, NOAO is equivalent to any other layered
product, e.g., STSDAS, TABLES, XRAY, CTIO, NSO, ICE, GRASP, NLOCAL, STEWARD,
and so on.  In general, layered products should be rooted somewhere outside
the IRAF directory tree to simplify updates.

Software management tools
-------------------------

IRAF software management is performed with a standard set of tools,
consisting of the tasks in the SOFTOOLS package, plus the host system
editors and debuggers.  Some of the most important and often used tools for
IRAF software development and software maintenance are the following.

*mkhelpdb*
  Updates the HELP database of the core IRAF system or an external
  package. The core system, and each external package, has its own
  help database.  The help database is the machine independent file
  `helpdb.mip` in the package library (LIB directory).  The help
  database file is generated with *mkhelpdb* by compiling the
  `root.hd` file in the same directory.

*mkpkg*
  The "make-package" utility.  Used to make or update package trees.
  Will update the contents of the current directory tree.  When run at
  the root iraf directory, updates the full IRAF system; when run at
  the root directory of an external package, updates the external
  package.  Note that updating the core IRAF system does not update
  any external packages (including NOAO).  When updating an external
  package, the package name must be specified, e.g., `mkpkg -p noao`.

*rmbin*
  Descends a directory tree or trees, finding and optionally listing
  or deleting all binary files therein.  This is used, for example, to
  strip the binaries from a directory tree to leave only sources, to
  force *mkpkg* to do a full recompile of a package, or to locate all
  the binaries files for some reason.  IRAF has its own notion of what
  a binary file is.  By default, files with the "known" file
  extensions (`.[aoe]`, `.[xfh]` etc.) are classified as binary or
  text (machine independent) files immediately, while a heuristic
  involving examination of the file data is used to classify other
  files.  Alternatively, a list of file extensions to be searched for
  may optionally be given.

*rtar*, *wtar*
  These are the portable IRAF tarfile writer (*wtar*) and reader
  (*rtar*).  About the only reasons to use these with the UNIX
  versions of IRAF are if one wants to move only the machine
  independent or source files (*wtar*, like *rmbin*, can discriminate
  between machine generated and machine independent files), or if one
  is importing files written to a tarfile on a VMS/IRAF system, where
  the files are blank padded and the trailing blanks need to be
  stripped with *rtar*.

*xc*
  The X (SPP) compiler.  This is analogous to the UNIX *cc* except
  that it can compile `.x` or SPP source files, knows how to link with
  the IRAF system libraries and the shared library, knows how to read
  the environment of external packages, and so on.


The SOFTOOLS package contains other tasks of interest, e.g., a program
*mktags* for making a tags file for the *vi* editor, a help database
examine tool, and other tasks.  Further information on these tasks is
available in the online help pages.

Modifying and updating a package
--------------------------------

IRAF applications development is most conveniently performed from within the
IRAF environment, since testing must be done from within the environment.
The usual  edit-compile-test development cycle is illustrated below.  This
takes place within the *package directory* containing all the files
specific to a given package.

 * Edit one or more source files.
   
 * Use *mkpkg* to compile any modified files, or files which include a
   modified file, and relink the package executable.
   
 * Test the new executable.

The mkpkg file for a package can be written to do anything,
but by convention the following commands are usually provided.

`mkpkg`
  The *mkpkg* command with no arguments does the default mkpkg
  operation; for a subpackage this is usually the same as *mkpkg
  relink* below.  For the root mkpkg in a layered package it udpates
  the entire layered package.

`mkpkg libpkg.a`
  Updates the package library, compiling any files which have been
  modified or which reference include files which have been modified.
  Private package libraries are intentionally given the generic name
  libpkg.a to symbolize that they are private to the package.

`mkpkg relink`
  Rebuilds the package executable, i.e., updates the package library
  and relinks the package executable.  By convention, this is the file
  `xx_pkgname.e` in the package directory, where *pkgname* is the
  package name.

`mkpkg install`
  Installs the package executable, i.e., renames the `xx_foo.e` file to
  `x_foo.e` in the global BIN directory for the layered package to which
  the subpackage *foo* belongs.

`mkpkg update`
  Does everything, i.e., a *relink* followed by an *install*.

If one wishes to test the new program before installing it one should do a
*relink* (i.e., merely type *mkpkg* since that defaults to relink), then
run the host system debugger on the resultant executable.  The process is
debugged standalone, running the task by giving its name to the standalone
process interpreter.  The CL task *dparam* is useful for dumping a
task's parameters to a text file to avoid having to answer parameter queries
during process execution.  The LOGIPC debugging facility introduced in V2.10
is also useful for debugging subprocesses.  If the new program is to be
tested under the CL before installation, a *task* statement can be
interactively typed into the CL to cause the CL to run the `xx_` version of
the package executable, rather than old installed version.

When updating a package other than in the core IRAF system, the `-p`
flag, or the equivalent `PKGENV` environment variable, must be used to
indicate the system or layered product being updated.  For example, `mkpkg
-p noao update` would be used to update one of the subpackages of the
NOAO layered package.  If the package being updated references any
libraries or include files in *other* layered packages, those packages
must be indicated with a `-p pkgname` flag as well, to cause the
external package to be searched.

The CL process cache can complicate debugging and testing if one forgets
that it is there.  When a task is run under the CL, the executing process
remains idle in the CL process cache following task termination.  If a new
executable is installed while the old one is still in the process cache, the
CL will automatically run the new executable (the CL checks the modify date
on the executable file every time a task is run).  If however an executable is
currently running, either in the process cache or because some other user is
using the program, it may not be possible to set debugger breakpoints.

The IRAF shared image can also complicate debugging, although for most
applications-level debugging the shared library is transparent.  By
default the shared image symbols are included in the symbol table of
an output executable following a link, so in a debug session the
shared image will appear to be part of the applications program.  When
debugging a program linked with the shared library, the process must
be run with the `-w` flag to cause the shared image to be mapped with
write permission, allowing breakpoints to be set in the shared image
(that is, you type something like `:r -w` when running the process
under the debugger).  Linking with the `-z` flag will prevent use of
the shared image entirely.

A full description of these techniques is beyond the scope of this manual,
but one need not be an expert at IRAF software development techniques to
perform simple updates.  Most simple revisions, e.g., bug fixes or updates,
can be made by merely editing or replacing the affected files and typing

.. code::
   
   cl> mkpkg

or

.. code::
   
   cl> mkpkg update

to update the package.

Installing and maintaining layered software
-------------------------------------------

The procedures for installing layered software products are similar to those
used to install the core IRAF system, or update a package.
Layered software may be distributed in source only form, or with binaries;
it may be configured for a single architecture, or may be preconfigured
to support multiple architectures.  The exact procedures to be followed
to install a layered product will in general be product dependent, and should
be documented in the installation guide for the product.

In brief, the procedure to be followed should resemble the following:

 * Create the root directory for the new software, somewhere outside
   the IRAF directories.

 * Restore the files to disk from a tape or network archive
   distribution file.

 * Edit the core system file hlib$extern.pkg to "install" the new
   package in IRAF.  This file is the sole link between the IRAF core
   system and the external package.

 * Configure the package BIN directory or directories, either by
   restoring the BIN to disk from an archive file, or by recompiling
   and relinking the package with *mkpkg*.

As always, there are some little things to watch out for.
When using *mkpkg* on a layered product, you must give the name
of the system being operated upon, e.g.,

.. code::

   cl> mkpkg -p foo update

where *foo* is the system or package name, e.g., "noao", "local", etc.
The `-p` flag can be omitted by defining `PKGENV` in your
UNIX environment, but this only works for updates to a single package.

An external system of packages may be configured for multiple architecture
support by repeating what was done for the core system.  One sets up several
BIN directories, one for each architecture, named `bin.arch`, where
*arch* is "sparc", "ddec", "rs6000", etc.  These directories, or
symbolic links to the actual directories, go into the root directory of the
external system.  A symbolic link `bin` pointing to an empty directory
bin.generic, and the directory itself, are added to the system's root
directory.  The system is then stripped of its binaries with *rmbin*, if
it is not already a source only system.  Examine the file zzsetenv.def in
the layered package LIB directory to verify that the definition for the
system BIN (which may be called anything) includes the string "(arch)",
e.g.,

.. code::

   set noaobin = "noao$bin(arch)/"

The binaries for each architecture may then be generated by configuring the
system for the desired architecture and running *mkpkg* to update the
binaries, for example,

.. code::

   cl> cd foo
   cl> mkpkg sparc
   cl> mkpkg -p foo update >& spool &

where *foo* is the name of the system being updated.  If any questions
arise, examination of a working example of a system configured for
multiple architecture support (e.g., the NOAO packages) may reveal the
answers.

Once installed and configured, a layered product may be uninstalled
merely by archiving the package directory tree, deleting the files,
and commenting out the affected lines of `hlib$extern.pkg`.  With the
BINs already configured reinstallation is a simple matter of restoring
the files to disk and editing the `extern.pkg` file.

Configuring a custom LOCAL package
----------------------------------

Anyone who uses IRAF enough will eventually want to add their own
software to the system, by copying and modifying the distributed
versions of programs, by obtaining and installing isolated programs
written elsewhere, or by writing new programs of their own.  A single
user can do this by developing software for their own personal use,
defining the necessary *task* statements etc.  to run the software in
their personal `login.cl` or `loginuser.cl` file.  To go one step
further and install the new software in IRAF so that it can be used by
everyone at a site, one must configure a custom local package.

The procedures for configuring and maintaining a custom LOCAL package are
similar to those outlined in \(sc3.5 for installing and maintaining
layered software, since a custom LOCAL will in fact be a layered software
product, possibly even something one might want to export to another site
(although custom LOCALs may contain non-portable or site specific software).

To make a custom local you make a copy of the "template local" package
(`iraf$local`) somewhere outside the IRAF directory tree, change the name
to whatever you wish to call the new layered package, and install it as
outlined in \(sc3.5.  The purpose of the template local is to provide the
framework necessary for a external package; a couple of simple tasks are
provided in the template local to serve as examples.  Once you have
configured a local copy of the template local and gotten it to compile and
link, it should be a simple matter to add new tasks to the existing
framework.

Updating the full IRAF system
-----------------------------

This section will describe how to recompile or relink IRAF.  Before we
get into this however, it should be emphasized that *most users will
never need to recompile or relink IRAF*.  In fact, this is not
something that one should attempt lightly - don't do it unless you
have some special circumstance which requires a custom build of the
system (such as a port).  Even then you might want to set up a second
copy of IRAF to be used for the experiment, keeping the production
system around as the standard system.  If you change the system it is
a good idea to make sure that you can undo the change.

While the procedure for building IRAF is straightforward, it is easy
to make a mistake and without considerable knowledge of IRAF it may be
difficult to recover from such a a mistake (for example, running out
of disk space during a build, or an architecture mismatch resulting in
a corrupted library or shared image build failure).  More seriously,
the software - the host operating system, the host Fortran compiler,
the local system configuration, and IRAF - is changing constantly.  A
build of IRAF brings all these things together at one time, and every
build needs to be independently and carefully tested.  An OS upgrade
or a new version of the Fortran compiler may not yet be supported by
the version of IRAF you have locally.  Any problems with the host
system configuration can cause a build to fail, or introduce bugs.
For example, systems which support multiple Fortran compilers or which
require the user to install and configure the compiler are a common
source of problems.

The precompiled binaries we ship with IRAF have been carefully
prepared and tested, usually over a period of months prior to a major
release.  They are the same as are used at NOAO and at most IRAF
sites, so even if there are bugs they will likely have already been
seen elsewhere and a workaround determined.  If the bugs are new then
since we have the exact same IRAF system we are more likely to be able
to reproduce and fix the bug.  Often the bug is not in the IRAF
software at all but in the host system or IRAF configuration.  As soon
as an executable is rebuilt (even something as simple as a relink) you
have new, untested, software.

The BOOTSTRAP
.............

To fully build IRAF from the sources is a four-step process.  First the
system is "bootstrapped", which builds the host system interface (HSI)
executables.  A "sysgen" of the core system is then performed; this compiles
all the system libraries and builds the core system applications.  The
bootstrap is then repeated, to make use of some of the functions from
the IRAF libraries compiled in step two, and the "sysgen" of the core system
is the repeated to compile parts of the system requiring the second
bootstrap code.

To bootstrap IRAF, login as IRAF and enter the commands shown below.
This takes a while and generates a lot of output, so the output should be
spooled in a file.  Here, *arch* refers to the IRAF architecture you
wish to build for.

.. code::
   
   % cd $iraf
   % mkpkg <arch>
   % cd $iraf/unix
   % reboot >& spool &


There are two types of bootstrap; the initial bootstrap starting from a
source only system, called the NOVOS bootstrap, and the final or VOS
bootstrap, performed once the IRAF system libraries `libsys.a` and
`libvops.a` exist.  The bootstrap script *reboot* will
automatically determine whether or not the VOS libraries are available and
will perform a NOVOS bootstrap if the libraries cannot be found.  It is
important to restore the desired architecture before attempting a
bootstrap, as otherwise a NOVOS bootstrap will always be performed.

The SYSGEN
..........

By sysgen we refer to an update of the core IRAF system - all of the files
comprising the runtime system, excluding the HSI which is generated by the
bootstrap.  On a source only system, the sysgen will fully recompile the
core system, build all libraries and applications, and link and install the
shared image and executables.  On an already built system, the sysgen
scans the full IRAF directory tree to see if anything is out of date,
recompiles any files that need it, then relinks and installs new executables.

To do a full sysgen of IRAF one merely runs *mkpkg* at the IRAF root.
If the system is configured for multiple architecture support one must
repeat the sysgen for each architecture.  Each sysgen builds or updates a
single BIN directory.  Since a full sysgen takes a long time and generates a
lot of output which later has to be reviewed, it is best to run the job in
batch mode with the output redirected.  For example to update the Solaris
binaries on a Sun workstation:

.. code::
   
   % cd $iraf
   % mkpkg ssun
   % mkpkg >& spool &

To watch what is going on after this command has been submitted and while
it is running, try

.. code::
   
   % tail -f spool

Sysgens are restartable, so if the sysgen aborts for any reason, simply fix
the problem and start it up again.  Modules that have already been compiled
should not need to be recompiled.  How long the sysgen takes depends upon
how much work it has to do.  The worst case is if the system and
applications libraries have to be fully recompiled.  If the system libraries
already exist they will merely be updated.  Once the system libraries are up
to date the sysgen will rebuild the shared library if any of the system
libraries involved were modified, then the core system executables will be
relinked.

A full sysgen generates a lot of output, too much to be safely reviewed for
errors by simply paging the spool file.  Enter the following command to
review the output (this assumes that the output has been saved in a file
named "spool").

.. code::
   
   % mkpkg summary

It is normal for a number of compiler messages warning about assigning
character data to an integer variable to appear in the spooled output
if the full system has been compiled.  There should be no serious error
messages if a supported and tested system is being recompiled.

The above procedure only updates the core IRAF system.  To update a layered
product one must repeat the sysgen process for the layered system.  For
example, to update the Sun/Solaris binaries for the NOAO package (which 
also requires the TABLES packages):

.. code::
   
   % cd $iraf/noao
   % mkpkg -p noao ssun
   % mkpkg -p noao -p tables >& spool &

This must be repeated for each supported architecture.  Layered systems are
independent of one another and hence must be updated separately.

To force a full recompile of the core system or a layered package, one can
use *rmbin* to delete the objects, libraries, etc. scattered throughout
the system, or do a "mkpkg generic" and then delete the `OBJS.arc.Z`
file in the BIN one wishes to regenerate (the latter approach is probably
safest).  A full IRAF core system sysgen currently takes anywhere from 30
minutes to 6+ hours, depending upon the system.


Localized software changes
..........................

The bootstrap and the sysgen are unusual in that they update the entire
HSI, core IRAF system, or layered package.  Many software changes are more
localized.  If only a few files are changed a sysgen will pick up the changes
and update whatever needs to be updated, but for localized changes a sysgen
really does more than it needs to (if the changes are scattered all over
the system an incremental sysgen-relink will still be best).

To make a localized change to a core system VOS library and update the
linked applications to reflect the change all one really needs to do is
change the desired source files, run *mkpkg* in the library source
directory to compile the modules and update the affected libraries, and then
build a new IRAF shared image (this assumes that the changes affect only the
libraries used to make the shared image, i.e., libsys, libex, libvops, and
libos).  Updating only the shared image, without relinking all the
applications, has the advantage that you can put the runtime system back the
way it was by just swapping the old shared image back in - a single file.

For example, assume we want to make a minor change to some files in the VOS
interface IMIO, compiling for the *ssun* architecture on Sun, which uses
a shared library.  We could do this as follows (this assumes that one is
logged in as IRAF and that the usual IRAF environment is defined).

.. code::

   % whoami
   iraf
   % cd $iraf
   % mkpkg ssun
   % cd imio
                                    # edit the files
   % mkpkg                          # update IMIO libraries (libex)
   %
   % cd $iraf/bin.ssun              # save copy of old shared image
   % cp S12.e S12.e.V212
   %
   % cd $iraf/unix/shlib
   % tar -cf ~/shlib.tar .          # backup shlib just in case
   % mkpkg update                   # make and install new shared image

If IRAF is not configured with shared libraries, one must relink the
full IRAF system and all layered packages for the change to take
effect.  This is done by running *mkpkg* at the root of the core
system and each layered package.  For example, on a RedHat Linux
system

.. code::
   
   % whoami
   iraf
   % cd $iraf
   % mkpkg redhat
   % cd imio
                                    # edit the files
   % cd iraf
   % mkpkg                          # update the core system
   %
   % cd noao
   % mkpkg -p noao redhat
   % mkpkg -p noao -p tables        # update the NOAO packages

and so on, for each layered package.

Changing applications is even easier.  Ensure that the system architecture
is set correctly (i.e. `mkpkg <arch>` at the iraf or layered package root),
edit the affected files in the package source directory, and type `mkpkg -p
<pkgname> update` in the root directory of the package being edited.  This
will compile any modified files, and link and install a new executable.
You can do this from within the CL and immediately run the revised program.

We should emphasize again that, although we document the procedures for
making changes to the software here, to avoid introducing bugs we do not
recommend changing any of the IRAF software except in unusual (or at least
carefully controlled) circumstances.  To make custom changes to an
application, it is best to make a local copy of the full package somewhere
outside the standard IRAF system.  If changes are made to the IRAF system
software it is best to set up an entire new copy of IRAF on a machine
separate from the normal production installation, so that one can experiment
at will without affecting the standard system.  An alternative which does
not require duplicating the full system is to use the `IRAFULIB`
environment variable.  This can be used to safely experiment with custom
changes to the IRAF system software outside the main system; IRAFULIB lets
you define a private directory to be searched for IRAF global include files,
libraries, executables, etc., allowing you to have your own private versions
of any of these.  See the system notes files for further information on how
to use IRAFULIB.

Graphics and Image Display
==========================

IRAF itself is device and window system independent, hence it can be used
with any windowing system such as X11 or SunView, or with hardware graphics
and display devices.  Nowadays most people will be running IRAF on a UNIX
workstation under X11.  The X11IRAF support package,
which includes the *xgterm* and *ximtool* programs for graphics and
imaging, is system independent and is distributed separately from IRAF.
IRAF can also be used with other graphics and image display servers, e.g.
*xterm* and *saoimage*.  The *x11iraf* utilities are available
from the IRAF network archives or by contacting IRAF site support.

Most people will prefer to use *xgterm* and *ximtool* (or a similar
display tool such as *saoimage*) for IRAF graphics and imaging.
*xgterm* is based on *xterm*, providing an equivalent vt100 (text
window) capability but a much enhanced graphics capability.  *ximtool*
provides a general interactive image display capability, including
support for multiple image frame buffers and frame blinking,
independent zoom, pan, and color enhancement for each frame, and many
other features.  Both programs are implemented at the host level as
general purpose window system tools, and are useful independently of
IRAF.  Detailed documentation on the basic operation and use of these
programs is available with the X11IRAF distribution.  Our concern in
this document is with the use of these programs within IRAF.

The X11 environment
-------------------

The graphics and image display tools provided with IRAF operate within the
X11 windowing environment much like the standard tools provided with
X11.  To help illustrate the use of these tools, IRAF is
distributed with a sample X11 environment already configured for the
IRAF account, the exact nature of these files depends on the platform.  
This consists, for example on a Sun/IRAF system, of the following files in 
the IRAF account login directory, iraf$local.

`.Xdefaults`
  Sets up the defaults for how the window system looks, e.g., defines
  the X resources controlling window colors, fonts, etc.

`.openwin-menu`
  An example of a simple custom rootmenu for the OpenLook window
  manager, including entries for xgterm and ximtool.  Other window
  managers will rely on a different configuration file, e.g. `.mwmrc`
  for Motif, `.twmrc` for the *twm* window manager, etc.

`.xinitrc`
  Executed at window system start up time to create all the windows,
  some systems require that this file be named `.xsession`.

No one screen layout will suit all users or all applications.
Everyone will wish to customize the workstation screen to suit their
preferences and the type of work they are doing.  However, the
configuration provided works and should be useful as an example of how
to make things function correctly.

Vector graphics capabilities
----------------------------

The standard graphics terminal emulator for IRAF under X11 is
*xgterm*, which emulates a conventional dual plane text/graphics terminal.
On systems to which xgterm has yet to be ported, such as VMS, *xterm*
is typically used, this is an equivalent terminal emulator but the 
graphics support isn't quite as nice.
This software terminal is driven via an ASCII datastream like a conventional
hard terminal (except that the effective baud rate is much higher).
The text window behaves like the system console and the graphics window
behaves like a Tektronix 4012, plus some IRAF oriented extensions.
Since xgterm emulates standard text and graphics devices non-IRAF programs
can easily be run as well as IRAF programs.

Configuring IRAF to use xgterm is very simple.  The following command does
the job.  This is normally executed by the login.cl or loginuser.cl file at
login time.

.. code::

   cl> stty xgterm

Further information on xgterm may be found in the *xgterm.info* file in
the IRAF network archive with the xgterm binaries or by contacting site
support.

Xterm users can define the window type similarly, i.e.

.. code::

   cl> stty xterm            # or
   cl> stty xtermjh

Since xterm lacks a true status line users may prefer the second example
which puts status output on the text window instead of overwriting the
graphics window.

Image Display capabilities
--------------------------

Image display for IRAF running in the X11 environment is provided by
*XImtool* or a comparable IRAF-compatible display server (e.g.
*SAOimage*).  The current
*XImtool* program provides a basic display capability, including
programmed access from the IRAF environment to load images, interactive
windowing of the display, pseudocolor, an interactive image cursor readback
capability, zoom and pan, a variety of frame buffer sizes, independent frame
buffer and display window sizing, up to four frames, each with its own
state, and programmable frame blink.  *ximtool* runs as a display
server, meaning that it sits idle most of the time, waiting for some client,
e.g., IRAF, to send it an image to be displayed via some form of
interprocess communication.

To use ximtool from within IRAF one must define the logical device and
enable image cursor input.  For example,

.. code::

   cl> reset stdimage = imt512

would configure IRAF and ximtool for use with a 512 pixel square frame buffer
(image display image memory).  A variety of frame buffer sizes are
predefined; see the `imtoolrc` file (normally in `/usr/local/lib`) for a
complete list of possible configurations or use the IRAF *gdevices* 
command.

The image cursor is enabled by

.. code::

   cl> reset stdimcur = stdimage

This is the default for Unix/IRAF.  Setting `stdimcur` to `text`
disables the image cursor, allowing cursor values to be typed in interactively
in the terminal window.  This is useful, for example, when running image
oriented programs from a simple terminal.

The standard IRAF interface to the display server is the *display* program
in the TV package.  Automatic determination of the optimum intensity mapping
to the 200 ximtool greylevels is provided.  Entire frames can be displayed,
or one can write to subregions of the display.  Other programs useful with
the image display include *imexamine*, used to interactively examine
images under image cursor control, *imedit*, used to edit images using
the display, and *tvmark*, used to write color graphics into a display
frame.

The display server has the capability of displaying the cursor (mouse)
position and pixel value in image pixel units as the mouse is moved about
in the window.  In addition, text file cursor lists can be generated and
displayed, or the image cursor can be read interactively from within IRAF.
The image cursor may be called up at any time by typing

.. code::

   cl> =imcur

into the CL.  Applications programs which read the interactive image cursor
will do this automatically during program execution.

Using the workstation with a remote compute server
--------------------------------------------------

A common mode of operation with a workstation is to run IRAF under
X11 directly on the workstation which runs IRAF, accessing files either
on a local disk, or on a remote disk via a network interface (NFS, IRAFKS,
etc.).  It is also possible, however, to run X11 with xgterm and ximtool
on the workstation, but run IRAF on a remote node, e.g., some powerful
compute server such as a large Sun server or a fast Linux PC, possibly quite
some distance away.
This is done by logging onto the workstation, starting up X11 and a
*xgterm* window, logging onto the remote machine with *rlogin*,
*telnet*, or whatever, and starting up IRAF on the remote node.
.LP
After IRAF comes up one need only type

.. code::

   cl> stty xgterm
   cl> reset node = hostname!

to tell the remote IRAF that it is talking to a xgterm window and that the
image display is on the network node *hostname*.  The trailing
exclamation point is required in V2.11 and later versions of IRAF to avoid
interpretation of general environment variables as network logical node names.
For this to work IRAF networking must be enabled between the two hosts (see
\(sc2.2.7).  Alternatively, an inet socket may be used to connect to the
ximtool directly by defining an `IMTDEV` environment variable.  For
example, suppose you are running IRAF on remote node but wish to
display to an ximtool running on your workstation which is in a different
network domain, to do this define something like

.. code::

   % setenv IMTDEV inet:5137:foo.bar.edu

prior to logging into the CL.  This overrides the normal display connection
selection and tells IRAF to display to inet socket 5137 running on node
"foo.bar.edu" (5137 is the default inet socket for ximtool).  The advantage
here is that one doesn't need to enable iraf networking for a host that may
only temporarily be used.

In this mode one is effectively using the workstation as a sort of super
terminal with powerful graphics and image display capabilities.  One gets
the best of both worlds, i.e., a state of the art user interface, and the
compute power of a large machine.  It matters little what operating system
is used on the remote machine, so long as it also runs IRAF.
Except for the details of the login sequence, operation is completely
transparent; xgterm does not care whether the process it is talking to is
on a local or remote node.  Performance, e.g,. for image loads, is often
*better* than when everything is run directly on the local node,
due to the more powerful server.

Interfacing New Graphics Devices
================================

There are three types of graphics devices that concern us here.  These
are the graphics terminals, graphics plotters, and image displays.
Useful documentation for writing graphcap entries is the GIO reference
manual and the HELP pages for the *showcap* and *stty* tasks,
information on creating new `graphcap` entries for each type of device
is covered in \(sc2.2.6.

Graphics terminals
------------------

The IRAF system as distributed is capable of talking to just about any
conventional graphics terminal or terminal emulator, using the
*Istdgraph* graphics kernel supplied with the system.  All one need do
to interface to a new graphics terminal is add new graphcap and
termcap entries for the device.  This can take anywhere from a few
hours to a few days, depending on one's level of expertise, and the
characteristics of the device.  Be sure to check the contents of the
`dev$graphcap` file to see if the terminal is already supported,
before trying to write a new entry.  Assistance with interfacing new
graphics terminals is available via the IRAF Hotline.

Graphics plotters
-----------------

The current IRAF system comes with several graphics kernels used to drive
graphics plotters.  The standard plotter interface the SGI graphics kernel,
which is interfaced as the tasks *sgikern* and *stdplot* in the
PLOT package.  Further information on the SGI plotter interface is given in
the paper *The IRAF Simple Graphics Interface*, a copy of which is
included with the IRAF installation kit or in our network archive /iraf/doc
directory as "sgi.ms".

SGI device interfaces for most plotter devices already exist, and adding
support for new devices is straightforward.  Sources for the SGI device
translators supplied with the distributed system are maintained in the
directory iraf/unix/gdev/sgidev.  NOAO serves as a clearinghouse for new SGI
plotter device interfaces; contact us if you do not find support for a local
plotter device in the distributed system, and if you plan to implement a new
device interface let us know so that we may help other sites with the same
device.

The older NCAR kernel is used to generate NCAR metacode and can be
interfaced to an NCAR metacode translator at the host system level to get
plots on devices supported by host-level NCAR metacode translators.  The
host level NCAR metacode translators are not included in the standard IRAF
distribution, but public domain versions of the NCAR implementation for UNIX
systems are widely available.  A site which already has the NCAR software
may wish to go this route, but the SGI interface will provide a more
efficient and simpler solution in most cases.

The remaining possibility with the current system is the *calcomp* kernel.
Many sites will have a Calcomp or Versaplot library (or Calcomp compatible
library) already available locally.  To make use of such a library to get
plotter output on any devices supported by the interface, one may copy
the library to the hlib directory and relink the Calcomp graphics
kernel.

A graphcap entry for each new device will also be required.  Information on
preparing graphcap entries for graphics devices is given in the GIO design
document, and many actual working examples will be found in the graphcap
file.  The best approach is usually to copy one of these and modify it.

Image display devices
---------------------

The standard image display facility for a Sun workstation running the
MIT X or OpenWindows window system is the *ximtool*, *DS9*, *SAOtng*,
or *saoimage* display server.  XImtool is available from the
`/iraf/x11iraf` directory of the `iraf.noao.edu` ftp archives, other
servers are available from the `iraf.noao.edu` archive `/contrib`
directory.

Some interfaces for hardware image display devices are also available,
although a general display interface is not yet included in the system.
Only the IIS model 70 and 75 are current supported by NOAO.  Interfaces for
other devices are possible using the current datastream interface, which is
based on the IIS model 70 datastream protocol with extensions for passing
the WCS, image cursor readback, etc. (see the ZFIOGD driver in unix/gdev).
This is how all the current displays, e.g., imtool and ximage, and the IIS
devices, are interfaced, and there is no reason why other devices could not
be interfaced to IRAF via the same interface.  Eventually this prototype
interface will be obsoleted and replaced by a more general interface.

Host System Requirements
========================

Any modern host system capable of running UNIX should be capable of running
IRAF as well.  IRAF is supported on all the more popular UNIX platforms,
as well as on PC operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and
OS X on Apple hardware.

A typical small system is a single workstation with a local disk.  In a
typical large installation there will be one or more large central compute
servers, each with tens of Gb of disk and many hundreds Mb of RAM, networked
to a number of personal or public workstations.  For scientific use, a
megapixel color screen is desirable. 

Memory requirements
-------------------

The windowing systems used in these workstations tend to be very memory
intensive; the typical screen with ten or so windows uses a lot of memory.
Interactive performance
will suffer greatly if the system pages a lot.  Fortunately, memory is
relatively cheap.  No system, including personal diskless
nodes, should be configured with less than 64 Mb of main memory; 128 Mb or
more is recommended if you plan to do a lot of image processing.  On
servers, 256Mb, 512Mb or even 1+ Gb is not an unreasonable amount of memory to
try to configure on the system.

Disk requirements
------------------

The amount of disk required by a user depends greatly on the application,
so it is hard to recommend a minimum disk size.  For a system with access
to a central server, no disk or 1-2 Gb of local disk is fine.
For a standalone system with no access to large server, 5-10 Gb is
about the minimum nowadays.

Diskless nodes
--------------

For an application such as programming or word processing, a diskless node
connected to a large file server is a cost effective approach delivering
good performance.  Some local disk for boot, swap, and local file storage
is desirable but not essential.  For most IRAF applications however, where
serious image processing is planned, one is inevitably going to want to
run large batch image processing jobs directly on the server, implying that
a *compute* rather than *file* server is what is needed (i.e., one
will want to avoid heavy NFS loading on the server).  A diskless node is
still viable, but one will want to run jobs which involve heavy disk i/o 
directly on the server, reserving the workstation for the interactive
things, e.g., graphics and image display, and compute bound image analysis
tasks.  Disks are getting cheap enough that almost any workstation equipped
with say, 128-256 Mb of memory, probably warrants several Gb of local disk
for server independence, swap, and local file storage.

Appendix A.  The IRAF Directory Structure
=========================================

The main branches of the IRAF directory tree are summarized below.
Beneath the directories shown are some 400 subdirectories, the largest
directory trees being `sys`, `pkg`, and `noao`.
The entire contents of all directories other than `unix`, `local`,
and `dev` are fully portable, and are identical in all installations
of IRAF sharing the same version number.

========= ===============================================================
`bin`     the IRAF BIN directories
`dev`     device tables (termcap, graphcap, etc.)
`doc`     assorted IRAF manuals
`lib`     the system library; global files
`local`   iraf login directory; locally added software
`math`    sources for the mathematical libraries
`noao`    packages for NOAO data reduction
`pkg`     the IRAF applications packages
`sys`     the virtual operating system (VOS)
`unix`    the UNIX host system interface (HSI = kernel + bootstrap utilities)
========= ===============================================================

The contents of the `unix` directory (host system interface) are
as follows:

========= ===============================================================
`as`      assembler sources
`bin`     the HSI BIN directories
`boot`    bootstrap utilities (mkpkg, rtar, wtar, etc.)
`gdev`    graphics device interfaces (SGI device translators)
`hlib`    host dependent library; global files
`os`      OS interface routines (UNIX/IRAF kernel)
`reboot`  executable script run to reboot the HSI
`shlib`   shared library facility sources
`sun`     gterm and imtool sources (SunView)
========= ===============================================================

If you will be working with the system much at the system level, it will be
well worthwhile to spend some time exploring these directories and gaining
familiarity with the system.
