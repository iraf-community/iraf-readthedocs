:Abstract: This document serves as a programmer’s manual for the IRAF
 Command Language version 1.0. CL tasks, packages, parameter files,
 modes, expressions, statements, abbreviations, environment variables,
 command logging, error handling and directives are discussed. The
 special CL parameters are listed. A example of a complete CL callable
 program is given.

 This manual is a programmer’s guide, not a user’s guide or a
 technical specification of the CL. Information about other
 programming tools within the IRAF system, such as the SPP language
 and compiler and the program interface, is given only to the extent
 required to introduce the examples.

Introduction
------------

The Command Language, or **CL**, serves as a command and runtime
supportive interface between the user at his computer terminal and the
application programs he is executing. The user types his commands to the
CL and it does whatever task and file manipulations are necessary to
carry out the commands.

The user and the applications task do not communicate directly; they
communicate only through the CL. Once started, a task requests
parameters by name from the CL and the CL responds with the value of the
parameter. To get that value, the CL may have had to read a parameter
file, query the user, do range checking, extract a value from a command
line or perform other actions.

All CL/task communications take place via an interprocess communications
link between the CL process and the process containing the applications
task. Standard input, output, error, and plotting channels are
multiplexed on this link and managed by the CL. The CL process and the
applications package process execute concurrently.

This arrangement relieves each new application program from having to
provide user interface functions that are often rewritten directly each
time, such as command line parsing, command and parameter abbreviations,
and levels of interaction to accommodate both novice and experienced
users. In addition, the CL provides a common environment for running all
tasks with services such as executing programs with their input and
output redirected to files or to other programs, managing parameters for
each command, handling lists of values in lieu of a simple parameter,
logical device and file name assignments, and help facilities. The CL is
a simple programming language in its own right, with conditional and
repetitive command execution, parameter expressions and a calculator.

While intended to support scientific reduction and analysis applications
at Kitt Peak and elsewhere, the CL can serve any project that involves
running programs as commands with arguments. Every effort has been made
to make the CL as portable as possible. The link between the CL and the
task it is running is character oriented and allows the task to to be
run directly without any support from the CL if desired. This link may
be simulated by any program that wants to run as a task under the
control of the CL. However, any task written in the SPP language (which
is Fortran based) will automatically include all the i/o facilities
required to interface to the CL.


Terminology
-----------

This section defines most of the terminology associated with the CL.
Words in **boldface** are part of the actual terminology of the CL.
Those in *italics* are more descriptive in nature and serve only to name
a representative item.

Physical and Logical Tasks, Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A task runnable under the CL is a file containing either the executable
program itself, or a text file containing a **script** written in the CL
language. Either of these is referred to as a **physical task** since
they are true files on the host computer. The executable form consists
of one or more **logical tasks** but the script file is always
considered exactly one logical task. The general terms **command** and
**program** refer to one of these logical tasks. In order to know just
how to go about running the command, the CL has a "task" declaration
that indicates in which file the task resides, and whether it is in an
executable or script form. Once declared, the logical task commands are
used the same way regardless of whether they reside in an executable
object file or a script.

In order to manage itself, there are a few commands that the CL does
itself, such as the "task" command mentioned above. These built-in
commands are referred to as CL **directives**, but only as a means of
classifying them as a group. They act and are used very much like
regular commands. In this way, they have the same syntax rules and their
diagnostics work in the same fashion. Since they are built into the CL
program itself to achieve intimate knowledge of its internal data
structures or simply to increase efficiency, the set of directives is
not extensible by the user.

Thus, there are a variety of ways a command may get executed. It is no
accident that there is often no easy way to tell how a command is
implemented.


Packages
~~~~~~~~

Ostensibly, tasks are grouped into packages. This provides a logical
framework to organize a large body of commands in a large system and
also serves to address the problem of redefinitions. The CL directives
and a few utility programs are located in the root package, called
**clpackage**, and is always present when the CL starts up. Some of the
commands in the root define more packages when run. They are script
tasks that define a package and some tasks in that package. By
convention, the name of the package defined by a script, the logical
task and the script physical task file name are all the same.

Any package defined to the CL may become the **current package**. The
prompt issued by the CL includes the first two characters of the current
package. When a command is typed to the CL, it looks in the tasks of the
current package first, then through all tasks in lower packages towards
the root clpackage for the logical task with the given name. Tasks
defined in packages defined farther away from the root are searched
last. This **circular search path** provides some measure of control
over command scope.

Wherever a task name is expected in the CL syntax, the package may be
explicitly specified in the form *package.task* so that only tasks
defined in that specific package will be considered in the search for
the given logical task name. This form allows package names farther away
from the root than the current package to be accessed. It also provides
an unambiguous way to reference a task when the task name appears in
more than one loaded package. If the name of a loaded package itself is
given as a command, then it simply becomes the current package (see the
package directive in `CL Parameters`_).

Parameter Files
---------------

A separate file, the **parameter file**, may exist for each logical
task. It contains a description of each of the parameters used by the
task that should be known and managed by the CL. (These are not the same
as variables declared in the source program for the task.) The parameter
files are the permanent record of task parameters. When a parameter
value is permanently changed, as with an assignment or when in learn
mode, the CL makes a local copy of the parameter file with the new
value. Thus, running tasks imply CL reads and writes to parameter files
as well as execution of the task.

A logical task need not have a parameter file. If a task makes a
request to the CL for a parameter and the CL knows the task has no
parameter file a fake query for the the parameter will be issued by
name (see `Modes`_ for more on queries). All of the range, prompt,
learning and type checking advantages of real parameters will be lost,
however. Thus, a parameter reference by a task that does not have a
parameter file at all is not considered an error. This is different
than a reference to a nonexistent parameter by a task that does have a
parameter file, which is an error.


Location and Name of Parameter Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter file for a logical task may be in two places. The CL first
searches the **uparm** directory, then the directory containing the
physical task. All physical tasks for a package, including the script
task that defines it, are usually in one directory, often referred to as
the **package directory**.

Uparm is an environmental entry used by the CL when accessing parameter
files. If it does not exist, the current directory is used. Uparm may
either be another environmental reference to a directory or be in
host-dependent format (see `Environment`_).

The names of parameter files written out, either to uparm or to the
current directory, are formed by concatenating the first two and final
characters of the package name, an underscore, the name of the logical
task, and the extension ".par". For example, when the parameter file for
a task *txyz* in package *pxyz* is written, it is named *pxz_txyz.par*.
The package prefix is prepended to avoid file name conflicts if two
tasks in different packages happen to have the same name. Since local
copies have the package prefix, the CL looks for them before ones
without the package prefix.


Parameter File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameter file for a logical task consists of comments, blank lines,
and parameter declarations. These may appear in any desired order.
Comment lines are those that begin with the sharp character, #, and
signal that it and all remaining characters on that line should be
ignored. The maximum line length is 132 characters.

Parameter declarations within the parameter file take the form

::
   
   name, type, mode, value, minimum, maximum, prompt

where all fields from value on are optional. The comma and the end of
the line itself both serve as a field delimiter and thus a comma is not
necessary after the last field, whatever it is.


name
^^^^

This is the name of the parameter. There is no length limit other than
the overall line length limit consideration. This is the name by which
the parameter will be known to the task and to the CL. It must begin
with a letter or a dollar sign, $, but the remaining characters may be
any combination of letters, numbers, underscore, \_, and dollar, $.
Casual use of $ is not recommended, however, as it is used to make
environment references (see `Environment`_).


type
^^^^

The type field indicates how the parameter is to be stored. It also
implies some information about what values are acceptable and how they
are entered, as discussed below under value.

============ ============
code	     meaning
============ ============
b            boolean
i            integer
r	     real
s	     string
f or f\ *xx* file name
struct       structure	
gcur         graphics cursor
imcur        image cursor
============ ============


The codes **b**, **i** and **r** indicate the usual boolean, integer and
real types. They are discussed further in the value section, below.

There are several types that manipulate character strings. The
characters themselves may be anything from the ASCII set. The type **s**
is the simplest and is an ordinary character string. It is typically
used for names, flags and messages.

The **f** type is like s except that it is limited to legal file names
on the host operating system, after possible environment substitution.
The f may optionally be followed by any reasonable combination of the
characters **e**, **n**, **r**, or **w**. These indicate that checks
should be made of the file name before it is used that it exists, does
not exist, that it exists and is readable and that it exists and is
writable, respectively. **Struct** is also like s but its value is the
entire next line of the parameter file.

**Gcur** and **imcur** are similar to struct but are expected to be of
the form "x y char" to be usable as cursor coordinates. A gcur or imcur
parameter will always read from the hardware graphics or image display
cursor if it is in query mode.

If the type is preceded by a star, \*, the parameter is
**list-structured**. When the parameter is referenced, the value will
come from a file, the name of which is the fourth field of the parameter
declaration. All of the basic types may be list-structured.


mode
^^^^

This field indicates what actions are performed when the parameter is
referenced or assigned. The topic of modes is important to the CL and is
covered more thoroughly elsewhere (`Modes`_) Briefly, query mode generally
causes the user to be queried each time the parameter is referenced.
Learn means that all changes to the parameter will be permanent. Auto
mode means that the effective mode of the parameter should be whatever
the mode is of the task that is using the parameter; auto mode defers
mode selection to the task, or CL level. Hidden means that the existence
of the parameter will not be evident to the user unless its value is not
acceptable.

The mode field may be any reasonable combination of query, learn, auto
and hidden. These may be spelled out and separated with plus signs, +,
or abbreviated to one character and run together. For example,
``...,auto+learn,...`` and ``...,al,...`` are equivalent.


value
^^^^^

This field is optional. The value field is the initial or **default**
value of the parameter. It has various characteristics depending on the
type of the parameter. If it is absent, the parameter will be marked as
undefined and will cause an error if used in an expression. A special
entry, **indef**, is allowed that marks the parameter value as being
indefinite, but not undefined. It may be used with all types. Acceptable
constants in the value field are like those allowed by the CL in
expressions (see `Constants`_).

For boolean parameters, it should be either the three characters **yes**
or the two characters **no**.

Integer and real parameters are as one would expect. Real constants need
not include a decimal point, ., if not required.

For string and file name parameters, the field extends from the comma
following the mode field to the next comma, or the end of the line if
none. It may be surrounded by single or double quotes, ’ or ", but these
are not necessary unless the string is to include a comma. The length of
the storage allocated for the string will be the minimum of 30
characters and the length of the initial value, up to a maximum of 132.
Later changes to the value of the string will be silently truncated to
the amount thus established.

Structs and the cursor types use the value field to indicate the number
of characters of storage to allocate to hold the value of the parameter.
The value is a string consisting of the entire next line of the
parameter file. If no number is given in the value field, then just
enough storage to hold the next line will be allocated. If the number is
larger, this allows the value to grow longer than the length of the next
line. Since dynamic string storage is not used in the CL, the length of
all strings is fixed and using the value field in this way permits a
short initial value but allows for later growth. The length of string
storage is limited to 132 characters. It is an error to explicitly
specify a storage length shorter than the initial value.

The value field for list-structured parameters is the name of the file
containing values for the parameter. This name is subject to the same
restrictions as a parameter of type fr and environmental references are
allowed.

Thus, the value field entry for a parameter in a parameter file has
several different uses, depending on the type of the parameter. The term
**value** refers to that which is used when the parameter is used in an
expression and **value field** refers specifically to the fourth field
of the parameter specification. Because of this multiple usage, the CL
recognizes this field with several names, as described under parameter
references (`Parameter References`_).


minimum and maximum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These two fields work together to specify a validity range for the value
of the parameter. They are ignored for all types except integer, real,
and file name parameters and follow the same rules as the value field
for these type parameters. Their application to filenames is to test for
a simple lexical ordering. If they are both set when the parameter is
referenced, then a query will be generated if the value of the parameter
is not within range. No range checking is done if either the minimum or
maximum are undefined or if min > max. If the parameter is
list-structured, then the range checking is applied to the entry read
from the file.


prompt
^^^^^^

This field behaves like a string and extends from just after the sixth
comma in the parameter spec to the end of the line. It may be quoted. As
explained more thoroughly under query mode, its purpose is to provide a
meaningful prompt for the parameter during a query. If no prompt string
is given, then the query will just use the name of the parameter. As
with strings, the length of the prompt implies the amount of static
storage to allocate; later changes to the the prompt will be silently
limited to this length.


Modes
-----

The CL supports three modes of operation, query, learn and auto.

**Query** mode is the most interactive and is the standard mode when the
CL is being used interactively. It causes each parameter referenced by a
task, or script, to produce a query on the terminal consisting of the
prompt string for that parameter, its current value and minimum and
maximum values, if set. If there is no prompt string, then the name of
the parameter is used. When the user sees this query, he may type a
simple return to accept the current value or type a new value. New
values that are entered in this way are checked for validity immediately
with regard to type and range, and the query repeats until a reasonable
value is entered.

A query will be generated regardless of the effective mode of the
parameter if it does not meet its range requirements. On the other hand,
a query will be prevented if the parameter was set on the command line,
again assuming it is not out of range. Thus, the CL relieves the
application program from some of the burden of verifying its parameters.

**Learn** mode retains the values of parameters across task runs and
even across CL sessions. The default values of parameters come from
their entries in the task’s parameter file. If learn mode is not in
effect, changes to parameter values by way of command line arguments to
the task or queries do not cause the parameter file to be updated and so
the values revert back to their defaults as soon as the task ends. Learn
mode makes these changes permanent by updating the parameter file for
the task.

**Hidden** mode applies only to parameters. It prevents queries from
being generated even if the effective mode for the parameter is query,
unless its value is out of range. Hidden mode also prevents the default
value from ever being "learned". The only way to change the default
value of a hidden parameter is by an assignment statement. Hidden mode
is useful for parameters that are rarely if ever changed to hide their
existence from all but experienced users.


Determining Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modes exist independently in a three level hierarchy: the parameter,
the current task, and the CL itself. Whenever a parameter is referenced,
its **effective mode** is calculated. To determine the effective mode,
the mode settings of the three levels are used starting with the
parameter level. If the mode of the parameter is query or learn, that is
the effective mode. If the parameter’s mode is **auto**, then the
effective mode is that of the current task unless it too is in auto mode
in which case the effective mode is that of the CL. If all levels are
auto, the effective mode is auto and neither query nor learn effects
will occur.

Thus, each layer of the hierarchy, starting at the parameter level,
defers to a higher level until it finds either query or learn (or both).
Note that the presence of hidden mode at the parameter does not alter
this process but rather serves to override query mode, should it be
found at any given level. As a practical example, all the auto-mode
parameters in a task can effectively be put into query mode at once by
setting the mode once at the task level to query.


Setting and Changing Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modes themselves are set in different ways at the parameter and task
level. The mode for a particular parameter is accessed as a field of
that parameter called **p_mode**. It may be abbreviated. The mode of a
task is in a parameter **mode**, of type string, that contains any
reasonable combination of the letters **q**, **l**, **a** and **h**.
This parameter may be declared and initialized as desired in the
parameter file for the task just like any other parameter. If it does
not appear in the parameter file for a task when it runs, it will be
manufactured and supplied with a default setting of ’ql’. This is the
only case of a parameter added by the CL to a parameter list for a task.
One of the parameters to the CL itself is also **mode**, and this serves
as the mode of the CL, the highest level in the mode hierarchy.

As a convenience for naming modes, four CL string parameters **query**,
**learn**, **auto** and **hidden** are defined to be the
single-character strings ’q’, ’l’, ’a’ and ’h’. Examples of setting
modes at the CL, task, and parameter levels::

  mode = 'ql'                      # set CL mode to query, learn
  package.task.mode = 'a'          # set given task mode to auto
  package.task.param.p_mode = 'ql' # set given parameter's mode
  mode = query + learn             # use pre-defined string params
  mode += query                    # add query

The mode of a parameter may also be changed during a query for that
parameter. If the response to the query begins with a percent, %, then
the mode for the parameter may be set using the same format as that
used in the parameter file mode field (see `Parameter File
Format`_). This is useful during program development for making a
parameter hidden once its default value has been determined.


Recommended Mode Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended default modes are auto and learn for the CL itself,
query for each task and auto or hidden for the parameters. Auto mode
for all non-hidden parameters in a task allows them all to be changed
at once by changing the mode of the task. The user will rarely do more
than change a task’s mode to auto, hide a parameter (by use of the %h
response to a query, `Setting and Changing Modes`_), or reset all
parameters of a task to their original default by deleting its
parameter file from the uparm directory (see `Location and Name of
Parameter Files`_).


Expressions
-----------

The CL allows expressions wherever a simple variable might appear. This
applies only to the language, however, not, for example, in the
parameter files. Expressions are the usual kinds of combinations of
constants, variables, intrinsic functions, operators, parentheses and
expressions (recursively).


Constants
~~~~~~~~~

Boolean constants are entered as the three characters "yes" or the two
characters "no". There are no true and false constants.

Integers are an uninterrupted sequence of digits; a trailing ‘b’ denotes
an octal constant.

Floating point constants are as in most languages but a decimal point is
not necessary if not needed. 5, 5., 5e0, .5e1 and 5.e0 are all
equivalent. Sexagesimal notation may also be used to create a floating
point value. A negative value is indicated by a leading minus sign, -,
leading zeros are not necessary and the seconds field is optional.
1:23:4.56, -12:3:4.5, 1:2:3 and -12:34 are all acceptable.

Strings are zero or more characters surrounded by single or double
quotes, ’ or ". The quotes are not needed in two cases. One is in
response to a query. In that case, everything up to the end of the typed
line is taken to be the string. If the quotes are used, however, they
will be discarded. The other case is when specifying the value of a
parameter on the command line when running a task. If the corresponding
parameter is of type string, filename or is list-structured and the
string need not be used in an expression, then the quotes are optional.

An additional constant, **indef**, is known to the CL. This is a special
setting that means indefinite, as opposed to being truly undefined. The
latter causes an abortive error if encounted during the evaluation of an
expression. A parameter that is merely indefinite does not result in an
error or a query and is useful for indicating the value should be
ignored, but propagated through an expression.

See the discussion of the intrinsic scan function (`Intrinsic
Functions`_) for two additional constants, EOF and stdin.


Parameter References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "variables" in CL expressions are task parameters. To reference a
parameter, the most general form is *package.task.param.field*. This
form may be used anywhere a parameter is legal. Only the parameter name
portion is required. If the package and task are not specified, the
parameters for the current task, then the current package and finally
those of the CL itself are searched. The parameter is not found if it
does not exist in one of these three places.

If the field is not specified, then the meaningful value of the
parameter is used, as explained under the discussion for the value
field of a parameter (see `Parameter File Format`_). The possible
fields are p_name, p_type, p_mode, p_value, p_minimum, p_maximum and
p_prompt. In addition, the value field may also be given as p_length,
p_default or p_filename.  These are intended for use with parameters
of type struct or cursor, integer or real, or filename (or
list-structured). These aliases are not strictly enforced but are
provided to improve readability and reliability in CL commands,
particularly within script tasks. Each portion of the parameter
reference may be abbreviated separately (see `Environment`_).

The result of using a logical operator is either the boolean true or
false. These values are represented internally as 1 and 0, respectively.
Although it is bad programming practice to make use of that fact in
further arithmetic operations, it is not prohibited.


Intrinsic Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CL provides a set of standard intrinsic functions that may be used
in expressions. They are much like those found in most math libraries
and are listed here only for reference. As with commands, they may be
abbreviated but unlike commands their arguments must be enclosed in
parentheses. Calling them with illegal arguments or producing underflow
or overflow generates an error. Their argument(s) may be integer or real
and they will try to return the same type as their argument if no loss
of precision would result.

============== =================== ===========================
Usage          Number of Arguments Description
============== =================== ===========================
abs(x)          1                  absolute value
atan2(y,x)      2                  arc tangent, with proper quadrant
cos(x)          1                  cosine
exp(x)          1                  natural exponentiation
frac(x)         1                  fractional part
int(x)          1                  integral part
log(x)          1                  natural logarithm

min(x1,x2...)   > 1                minimum
mod(x,modulo)   2                  first arg modulus the second
round(x)        1                  nearest integer, rounded away from zero

sin(x)          1                  sine
sqrt(x)         1                  square root
tan(x)          1                  tangent
============== =================== ===========================


The **scan** intrinsic function reads from its first argument as a
string and assigns the pieces, suitably type cast, into the remaining
arguments. If the first argument is a list-structured parameter, the
next line of the file is read and scanned, unless query mode is in
effect in which case the user is always prompted for the line. If the
first argument is a string-type parameter, including filename, struct,
gcur or imcur, then the string is scanned. This serves as an in-core
read, much like a Fortran decode or a C sscanf function. Spaces, tabs
and commas are recognized delimiters. If the last target parameter is a
string, it will receive the remainder of the string being scanned.

Scan returns as its function value the number of successful conversions.
Reading from a list and encountering eof will cause scan to return a
count of zero. There is a pre-defined constant in the CL, **EOF**, which
is simply zero; it may be used to make the test more explicit. There is
another CL constant, **stdin**, which may be used as the first argument
to cause scan to read from the standard input. Examples of scan are::

  # Read gcur and print radii until end of list.
  while (scan (gcur, x, y, remainder) >= 2)
      = sqrt (x∗∗2 + y∗∗2)

::
 
  # Read until EOF is detected.
  while (scan (file, line) != EOF)
      = line


Operators
~~~~~~~~~

The following is a list of the arithmetic and logical operators
available in the CL. They are the same as in the SPP language.

=========== ============== =====================================
Operator(s) Type of Result Function
=========== ============== =====================================
+, -, \*, / numeric        the usual, but see below for + with strings
\*\*        numeric        raise to power
%           numeric        first expression modulus the second; like mod()
<, >        logical        less than, greater than
<=, >=      logical        less than or equal, greater than or equal
==, !=      logical        equal, not equal
&&          logical        logical "and"
\|          logical        logical "or"
!           logical        logical "not"
=========== ============== =====================================

For those familiar with C, note the absence of =. It is not considered
an operator that produces an l-value but may only be used in an
assignment statement.

The + operator can be used to concatenate strings. If only one of its
operands are strings, the other will be converted first. If one operand
is a string, the other is an integer and the string operand contains an
integer on the same side as the integer operand, then an arithmetic
addition will be performed as well. For example::

  'stringa' + 'stringb'	   -> 'stringastringb'
  'string1' + 'string2'	   -> 'string1string2'
  'string1' + 2	           -> 'string3'
  2 + 'string1'	           -> '2string1'
  2 + '9string'	           -> '11string'
  'string' + boolean_param -> 'stringyes' (or 'stringno')

Points, ., in strings with digits are not recognized as floatings so
trying to add floatings to strings, while not prohibited, probably
doesn’t do anything useful.


Statements
----------

Statements fall into the following categories: assignments, commands,
immediate and flow control. These will are discussed separately, below.

Statements may be delimited by newline or semicolon, ;, and may be
grouped with brackets, { and }. Nesting is supported. Comments begin
with the sharp character, #, which indicates that all characters from it
to the end of the line are to be ignored. Statements that are too long
to fit on a line may be continued by ending the line with a backslash,
\\ or they are automatically continued if the last character is a comma.

When used from a terminal, the CL issues a continuation prompt, >>>,
when the outermost statement has not been completed. This indicates
input is still being accepted and parsed. No work will actually be done
until the CL sees a complete input statement.


Assignment Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **assignment** is a statement of the form *parameter = expression*.
The parameter is always permanently changed by an assignment statement,
whether or not learn mode is in effect.

Two additional forms of assignments are provided that also perform
arithmetic, *param += exp* and *param −= exp*. These are equivalent to
*param = param + exp* and *param = param − exp*. They are more efficient
as well as more convenient. These forms also permanently change the
parameter.

All forms of the assignment statements will cause an error if the
result of *exp* is undefined. Thus, the CL will never allow a
parameter to be set to an undefined state. The only way to get an
undefined parameter is by not setting it in a parameter file (see the
value discussion in `Parameter File Format`_). Assignment statements
are the only way a hidden parameter may be permanently changed.


Commands
~~~~~~~~

A **command** is the basic means of running logical tasks. It consists
of the name of the logical task, possibly with arguments, and pipes to
more commands or io redirections. The arguments to the command, if any,
may optionally be surrounded by parentheses. These are recommended in
scripts. Command lines may be continued on the next line automatically
if they end with a comma or a backslash.


Command Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The arguments to a command are given as a comma-separated list and come
in two basic forms, positional and absolute. The **positional** form is
any general expression. The expressions will be evaluated and assigned
one-to-one to the corresponding parameters of the task, as defined by
their order in the task’s parameter file, not counting hidden
parameters. Only the value of the parameter may be set in this manner. A
lone comma may be used as a placeholder and skips a parameter without
changing it. Parameters not reached in the matching are also not
changed.

The **absolute** form is an assignment, *parameter = expression*, where
the parameter must be a parameter of the task being run. This is useful
when a parameter value is to be changed but its position in the argument
list is not known or it would be awkward to arrive at its position by a
large number of positional arguments. Since the parameter is explicitly
named, fields other than the default value may be changed with the
absolute form.

Another form of absolute argument is the **switch**. It is a shorthand
way of specifying the truth value of a boolean parameter. A switch
consists of the parameter followed by a plus, +, to set it to yes, or a
minus, −, to set it to no. Thus, these two forms are equivalent ways of
turning off the boolean parameter *option*::

  task option=no
  task option−

While they may be used together, all positional arguments must precede
absolute arguments. Here are examples of using the positional and
absolute forms together (note the parens in the second example are
optional)::

  task1 x, task2.param, op+
  task3 (a, b, c, param2=x+y, op3−, param3=task4.x/zzz)
  task4 x, y, z, op1+, op2=yes

Parameters changed on the command line will have their new values as
long as the command is executing. If learn mode is not in effect for the
parameters, they will revert back to their original values when the task
ends or if the task aborts for some reason.


Pipes and Redirections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **pipe** connects the standard output of one task to the standard
input of another task. A pipe is indicated by separating the tasks with
a vertical bar, \|. As many pipes in a series may be used as necessary.
**Redirections** of the standard input and output of a task from or to
files are also supported.

The standard input may come from a file by indicating the filename after
the less-than symbol, <, and the standard output from the last task in a
pipe sequence may be sent to a file by giving its name after the
greater-than symbol, >. Two greater-thans, >>, cause the output to be
concatenated to the end of the file. If the output redirection symbol is
preceded by an ampersand, &, then the standard error will also be
included, as in &|, &> and &>>. Output redirections, but not pipes, are
considered absolute arguments to the task so they must follow any
positional arguments and must be set off by commas. For example, task1
reading from file t1input piped to task2 writing to file t2output is
done as

::

   task1 x,y,z, < t1input \| task2 x2, y2=a+b, > t2output
  

Immediate Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the **calculator** mode of the CL. It consists of the basic
assignment statement without the left-hand side parameter, as in "*=
exp*". Instead of computing the expression and assigning it to a
parameter, the result is simply sent to the standard output. This may in
turn be redirected if the calculation is being done from a script.


Flow Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CL provides **if-then-else** and **while** program flow control
constructs. These look like::

  if (expr) 
      statement     
  else
      statement     

and::

  while (expr)
      statement

This is quite general since the "statement" may be a group of statements
in brackets. Also, since if-then-else is itself a statement, they may be
chained into if-then-else-if- and so on. The else clause is optional.


Abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the boolean CL parameter **abbreviations** is yes, then packages,
commands, intrinsic functions and parameters may be abbreviated. The
scope of the abbreviation is limited by its context. For example, if a
parameter reference is *task.param*, the only candidates for the param
abbreviation are those parameters belonging to the given task;
similarly for parameter names given in the absolute form of a task’s
argument list. Parameter fields, such as p_name and so on, are always
considered within their own class so their briefest forms are always
p_n, p_t, p_mo, p_v, p_l, p_d, p_f, p_mi, p_ma and p_p (see `Parameter
References`_). The intrinsic functions are also in their own class.

Abbreviations are not allowed in scripts. They are intended only to
streamline interactive work with the CL.

Environment
-----------

The **set** CL directive, as explained elsewhere (`CL Parameters`_),
provides a simple string substitution mechanism for filename
translations. Most operating systems allow a logical assignment to a
physical device name for use in filenames. The CL trys to merge this
with its own environment table so that definitions in the host system
are available within the CL in addition to new entries added by
the CL. Typical uses for the translations are portable names for
system-dependent directories and io devices, such as tape.

The CL keeps its environment table in a last-in first-out fashion. New
entries hide but do not overwrite old entries. Substitutions take place
in strings being used as file names in commands and in parameter files.
This includes list-structured parameters and io redirection. Environment
references are indicated by following them with a dollar, $. For
example, if the following environment definition is made::

  set mydir = ’/usr/myname/dir/’

then these uses::

  task x, y, z, > mydir$file1
  task2 filename = mydir$file2

become::

  task x, y, z, > /usr/myname/dir/file1
  task2 filename = /usr/myname/dir/file2

Note that the quotes around the value for mydir are necessary since the
slashes are not legal in identifiers.

The environment facility is strictly a string substitution mechanism.
Directory names and other uses must be complete enough so that a valid
filename is the direct result of the substitution; the environment
facility has no knowledge of file naming requirements on the host system
whatsoever.


Log File
--------

If the boolean CL parameter **keeplog** is yes, then each command typed
by an interactive CL will be entered into a log. Commands that come to
the CL from tasks or scripts are not kept. The name of the file is in
the filename CL parameter **logfile**. This parameter is only used when
logging is started. To change the name of the logging file after logging
has already begun, set keeplog to no, change the value of logfile, then
restart logging by setting keeplog to yes. Each time logging starts, the
current time is entered in the log file as a CL comment.


Error Handling
--------------

From the start, the single most important requirement of the CL was that
it properly handle error conditions. As one veteran put it, "the error
case is the normal case, and the case when the program runs perfectly is
the abnormal case" [*]_.

To most easily explain error recovery in the CL, the discussion diverges
for a moment to explain a bit of its internal structure. Each new
logical task that is run pushes a data structure onto a control stack.
This structure indicates, among other things, where the standard input
and output for the task are connected and process control information.
As each task dies, its control structure gets popped off and the exposed
task resumes as the active one.

When a task encounters an error, it issues a diagnostic to its standard
error and informs the CL. The CL then repeatedly pops tasks, killing
them as necessary, until it uncovers one that had its input and output
connected to the terminal. Thus, an error condition forces a return to
an interactive task, most likely an instance of the cl directive.

As each task is popped, its name and the parameters that were set on the
command line when it was run are given as a kind of "stack trace" to aid
diagnosis. Parameter files of tasks that abort due to their own errors
or because they got killed on the way to restoring an interactive state
are not updated. The environment, package and task definitions, and all
other extensible data structures, are restored to their state at the
time the resumed task was pushed.

The diagnostics from the CL all begin with "ERROR:". This always means
that the full abortive procedure outlined above has occurred. If an
internal consistency check fails, this becomes "INTERNAL ERROR:". A few
diagnostics begin with "WARNING:". Warnings do not invoke the abortive
procedure but are merely informative messages generated during command
processing.

Perhaps the least helpful error messages are "syntax error" and "parser
gagged". These are generated by the parser when it has no idea of what
it is trying to crack or when it gets terribly confused. The only
advice, until the improved parser of CL2 is available, is to carefully
inspect the offending statement. If the error occurs during the
interpretation of a script, an approximate line number is also given.

CL Initialization
-----------------

When the CL starts up, it tries to read two CL script files. The first
is in an IRAF system-wide directory and is called **clpackage.cl**. It
defines the tasks in the root package clpackage, makes useful
environment entries and does other chores such as printing news. The
other is called **login.cl** and will be run if found in the current
directory from which the CL is started. This serves as a way to
personalize the CL on a per-user basis. Typical uses are to set modes,
options and uparm, define personal tasks and packages and make
environment entries for frequently used directories. Note that login.cl
is run as a genuine script and any changes it makes to the dictionary
after doing a "keep" will be lost.


CL Directives
-------------

The following commands are handled directly by the CL. They are always
available in the root package, clpackage. They behave as all other
commands in that they may be abbreviated and may have their input and
output redirected as desired. Arguments in square brackets, [ and ], are
optional.

bye
  Exit the current task and resume the previous one where it left
  off. If there is no previous task, then the CL ends. Any task
  declarations, cached parameter files and environment definitions not
  kept (see keep) will be discarded from core. The same effect may be
  achieved by typing EOF (control-z on DEC systems). If used in a
  script task, it causes the script to abruptly end as though the end
  of the script file had been encountered. Since most packages are
  defined in scripts that do the cl directive, bye often has the
  effect of exiting from an entire package (see cl).

cache lt [, lt2, ...]
  Read the parameter file for each given logical task(s) into the
  dictionary. They will remain in core until the current task exits
  (see bye). This is useful before running a task repetitively to
  reduce the file i/o required to bring in and possibly update the
  task’s parameter file each time it runs.

cl
  Run the cl itself as a task. This is generally useful in script
  tasks to stop the script midstream and allow terminal interaction
  again. The script might start with a package declaration, make some
  set and task declarations then do "cl()". This would cause the cl to
  run as a subtask to the script task and allow user interaction, with
  the new package and tasks. When the cl sees bye or EOF, the script
  task resumes, doing whatever cleanup it desires and exits, taking
  the new package, tasks and other dictionary changes with it. Other
  uses of the cl directive are to run script tasks. Since its input
  can be redirected, as with any other task, "cl < file" is a way to
  run a script file. Note: just where the cl gets its input when run
  without arguments is still being discussed but the above
  description, as far as it goes, should not change.

keep
  Cause all currently defined tasks and packages and any cached
  parameter files to remain in core when the current task
  ends. Normally, all dictionary space used by a task is discarded
  when the task ends. If any further dictionary changes are made, they
  will be discarded as keep only retains what was defined at the
  instant it is used. Keep only effects the current task. When the
  task from which the current task was called ends, the kept
  dictionary space will be discarded unless keep was called in the
  prior task as well.

lparam lt [, lt2, ...]
  List all parameters for the given logical task(s), if any. The name,
  current value, and prompt string is given for each, one per
  line. The parameters are given in the order in which they should be
  used as positional arguments in commands. Hidden parameters are
  listed at the end, surrounded by parentheses.

package packname
  Create a new package with the given name. The parameter file
  associated with the current task, if any, is associated with the
  package and becomes the package’s parameter file. All later task
  declarations will go into this package. A package declaration
  normally occurs in a script task, which creates the package and
  defines are tasks therein. If the package already exists, an error
  is indicated.

  As an aside, if the name of an existing package is itself given as a
  command, then it is pushed and run as a kind of task; nothing is
  changed in the dictionary. Bye or EOF will pop this pseudotask and
  return the current package setting to its previous state. This is
  useful for temporarily changing the search path for commands when a
  few commands in a package are needed without having to worry about
  tasks with the same name in other packages being found instead (see
  `Packages`_).

redefine [lt1, lt2, ...] lt = pt
  Exactly like the task directive except that redefinitions are
  allowed. A warning message is still issued, however, if a
  redefinition does occur.

set [name = value]
  Make a new, or redefines an existing, environment entry. If given
  without arguments, all current entries are simply listed, one per
  line.  Entries are made in the dictionary so are subject to the same
  rules as other dictionary objects, that is, entries are discarded
  when the task that does the set ends unless it uses keep. New
  entries are always made at the top of the list. Since searching also
  starts at the top, a second entry with the same name as an existing
  one will make the first entry inaccessible. An attempt is made to
  merge the environment facilities of the host operating system with
  the entries managed by set. Examples are given in the environment
  discussion.

task [lt1, lt2, ...] lt = pt
  Define the logical task(s) found in the given physical task. All
  entries are made in the current package. Pt is the name of the
  physical task file. It may be in terms of environmental directories
  or, if quoted, may be given in host-dependent form. If it ends in
  ".cl", the file is assumed to be a script written in the CL
  language.

  The logical tasks, lt1, lt2 and so on are the logical tasks that can
  be run from the physical task. At least one must be given. If the
  logical task name is prepended with a dollar, $, then no parameter
  file is to be associated with that task. If a newly declared logical
  task redefines an existing one in the current package, an error
  message is issued and the entry will not be made. Other logical
  tasks that do not conflict will still be entered, however. It is not
  an error to reference a physical task in more than one task command.

update lt [, lt2, ...]
  Cause the in-core parameter file for the given task(s) to be written
  out. This is used in conjunction with cache to force an update of a
  parameter file before the current task ends. It may also be used to
  force an update of a parameter file that would not otherwise be
  updated, that is, when learn mode is not effect.

version
  Give the current version number of the CL. The current
  implementation gives the time at which the program was built. The
  "version" of the CL for the near future is always considered to be
  1.2.

? and ??
  The "?" command gives the names of all the logical tasks defined in
  the current package. The format is an indented, multicolumn
  block. Entries are read left-to-right top-to-bottom in the order in
  which they are searched (opposite of the order they were
  declared). The "??" command is similar but includes all
  packages. Packages and tasks that lie above the current package, and
  are thus not immediately accessible, are given in parentheses.


CL Parameters
-------------

Some of the parameters belonging to the CL logical task itself have
special significance. Many of them have been mentioned elsewhere. These
parameters behave according to all the usual rules but they are used
internally by the CL or by utility tasks to specify options. All the CL
parameters may be viewed with "lparam cl". CL parameters not included in
the following list are provided as handy scratch variables. Other
parameters will be added as time goes on.

============= ========= =============================================
param         type      usage

An Example
----------

This is a complete example of a package, **coord**, written for the CL
environment. The package contains two logical tasks, **airmass** and
**precession**. Airmass accepts **elevation** and **scale** and computes
airmass. The result is printed and saved in a parameter **airmass**.
Precession computes the precession between any two years, **year1** and
**year2**. The ra and dec for year1 are read from the standard input and
the precessed coordinates to year2 are written to the standard output.
These two logical tasks are written in the SPP language and are defined
in the single physical task, **coord.x**.

The following are examples of actual running programs. The name of the
files in each case is given in boldface and is not part of the files.
Numerous other examples can be found in the source directories for the
IRAF system.

The login.cl file (see `CL Directives`_) defines the logical task
**coord** as the script task **coord.cl** in its own directory.

file **login.cl**::

  # When the CL starts up, it looks for a "login.cl" file in the
  # current directory. The login file should contain any commands
  # or declarations which one wants executed upon startup. A KEEP
  # or CL command must be executed after the declarations section
  # or the new definitions will go away.

  # The logical directory uparm, if defined, is where the CL will
  # save updated parameter files. Other IRAF system routines also
  # use this directory to store user-specific database files.

  set  uparm = "/usr/jacoby/iraf/tasks/param/"                 
  task $coord = "/usr/jacoby/iraf/tasks/coord/coord.cl"        

  keep # keep additions to dictionary when login.cl terminates 

file **coord.cl**::

  # CL script task to define and run the "coord" coordinate tool
  # package. When this script task runs, it defines the package
  # "coord", the package directory "codir", and the two logical
  # tasks comprising the package, AIRMASS and PRECESS. The task
  # CL is called to process commands from the user. When CL
  # terminates, COORD will also terminate (since there are no more
  # commands in the file), causing the package and its contents to
  # become undefined.
