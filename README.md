# IRAF readthedocs "sources"

This repository extracts the online documentation for IRAF from the
[Github "main" branch](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf) which
are then pushed to [Read the
Docs](https://iraf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Note that (except of the main `index.rst`) all `.rst` files in the
`docs` subdirectory are autogenerated from IRAF. So, if you find
spelling errors, they should be fixed there.
